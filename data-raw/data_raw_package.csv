"Campbell, John Kennedy 1964 Honour, Family and Patronage: A Study of Institutions and Moral Values in a Greek Mountain Community Oxford: Clarendon Press https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=eh01-011","But a man does not feel any embarrassment in asking for help from a kinsman. In these circumstances there is no shame in being under obligation or a debt of gratitude. Irrespective of the state of the balance of favours and counter favours, collateral relatives of the same generation, by reason of their kinship, are conceptually equal since they are descended from a pair of siblings who, before marriage and apart from the chances of age and sex, were socially equivalent persons. A man does not lose prestige through obligation to a kinsman; on the contrary his reputation is increased, for the community pays attention to a person whose kinsmen lend him immediate and effective support. And for the man who gives aid to his kin, the knowledge that men learn of his actions through the gratitude of the kinsman who receives it, is sufficient recompense. For in this way he wins a reputation as a man of honour ‘who supports his kinsmen’. If through wealth or influence a man is in a position to act as a general protector of his kindred, not only is he expected to do so, but this, in most cases, is also his wish. There is some altruism here. A man takes pleasure in the company of his kinsman; he finds him on occasion a source of practical advantage, but in particular he holds to him and has confidence in him simply because he is a kinsman. And for these reasons complaints of ingratitude against kinsmen are relatively few. The ties between unmarried sisters are particularly close. If dishonour attaches to one sister, it infects them all. Together, passively and modestly, they await with anxiety for some stranger to ask for their hand, an event which is both dreaded and desired. Unlike the brothers who separate to carry out their different work, the sisters are constantly in one another's company and are often working together at the same task. Their relationship differs from that of brothers in the absence of any considerable rivalry. While brothers stand in the public gaze, sisters are closeted within the privacy of domestic life. The reputation of a girl does not depend upon positive self-assertion, but rather on the passive preservation of her virginal condition. She succeeds in this through the closest possible association with her sisters; their physical inseparability is her chief defence against the slander of enemies. Differences in physical beauty may cause some jealousy but these are facts which cannot be altered and, since sisters in any case marry strictly in order of seniority, competition to snare a husband does not exist. The absence of competitive attitudes between sisters means that any elaborate fiction of differentiated roles is unnecessary, and sisters work happily and amicably at the same task without any serious comparison of productivity or skill. It is clear that the various difficulties between parents and children are all related in some degree to the necessary involvement of the individual and his family in the community's system of prestige values. When the child begins to play a representative role outside the family the father has to educate and discipline it in a way that puts a considerable strain on a small boy or girl. An adolescent son in adopting the prescribed attitudes of manliness becomes abrupt to his mother. The adult ‘pallikari’ is particularly sensitive to his public reputation for honour and self-assertion, and it is this that bedevils his relations with his father. Thus the peculiarly clear-cut complementarity of the parental roles has to do with the fact that when the relation of a child (particularly a son) to one of his parents is strained, the relation to the other parent is one of positive attachment and identification. Nevertheless, through the possession of shame it is always open to a woman to discipline and redeem her sexuality. The inclinations of her nature, whether conscious or not, make this difficult; but it is the prerequisite of honour. Virginity is a quality which provokes the deepest respect and a sense almost of awe. But the moral dualism of the sexes is finally transcended through the paradox that from women are born the noble sons who will protect the honour of the race. And, as the mother of adult sons whose reputation for manliness is untouched, and as a woman now past the period of her active sexuality, she has almost overcome the moral disabilities of her sex. Lambros, the leader of a substantial co-operating ‘company’, has a reputation for craftiness. In 1937, in the winter pastures, he shared a grazing boundary with a family of Albanian Muslims who owned a property of 250 acres. Foreseeing that at some time in the future these Albanians might be expelled from Greece, Lambros filed a statement with the court of First Instance to the effect that he had held a lease of protected rights over this property since 1929. At the time there was no reason for the clerk to verify Lambros's statement, since any attempt to implement a false statement would have been repudiated with ease by the owners; and Lambros would have faced a serious charge of perjury. Lambros's foresight was justified in 1944 when the Muslims fled from Thesprotia. He was now able to produce his document and in a few weeks he was duly confirmed in his rights of protected lease over a property which in fact he had never previously occupied. It is this kind of subtlety that wins for a man the reputation for cleverness. Finally, the degree of dependence on, or independence of, others is a factor which differentiates the prestige of heads of family. To be a tselingas, or a member of the dominant sibling group of a co-operative association of families, carries the greatest prestige. The dependence of a man without brothers on more distant kinsmen is by no means dishonourable, but it is clearly a situation of less prestige. But the family head who is forced to watch the sheep of another unrelated Sarakatsanos, or a villager, for a wage (ρόγα) forfeits any pretension to social reputation. It suggests that he is so poor that he cannot live from his flock without the money supplement of the wage, or that he has no relatives with substantial flocks with whom he might co-operate, or that he is not acceptable to them. Customarily a shepherd's wage is paid only partly in money, the balance being given in kind, grain, and a pair of shoes for every six months of service. The galling feature of becoming a wage shepherd is the fact of dependence on an unrelated man and the sense of being a kept man.After a man retires from the active arrangement of affairs, which he hands over to his eldest son, he is referred to as the ‘old man’. He is now expected to become a man who is dignified but quiet (□συχος). He ought to be quiet in the very literal sense that he does not attempt to cross the authority of his son when the latter makes a decision or issues an order. Quarrels between father and son detract from the dignity and prestige of both individuals. But the old man ought also to acquire an inward quietness of spirit, which follows from his release from the worries and cares of leadership and the knowledge that he has reached old age with his reputation for honour untouched. For this reason he ought no longer to possess a sensitive self-regard. For good, or ill, the record of his life will have established his social reputation. Now he ought only to be provoked by extreme insults. Such insults will in any case be judged as wanton and dishonourable, and will rebound on the reputations of those who level them. Normally there is no shame in delivering insults, only in receiving them. But a man of worth does not revile or pick quarrels with women, children, or old men. These categories of persons are inviolable. On the other hand, old men are expected to accept with dignity and good humour the mild affectionate mockery which is directed at them by their juniors. The maiden's cultivation of her shame demands that her clothes hide her femininity. Her hair is hidden under a black cotton scarf. A girl who by artifice or accident allows her scarf to become frequently undone gains an evil reputation. The only concession to the display of the hair is that girls grow their hair long, plaited into pigtails. The length of these pigtails, often artificially increased, is a point of pride and beauty. Thick, black, homespun blouses and woollen cardigans are buttoned to the neck and the wrists. The breasts are not supported and the shapeless bodice of the blouse effectively prevents the least hint of a provocative contour. A black woollen skirt is worn to the ankles. Generally as many as three thick underskirts are also worn under this. The general impression of the whole costume is one of shapelessness. The shame which is felt at the exposure of the body, even when no other person is present, means that undergarments are not changed for long periods and the body between the neck and the ankles is never washed. In contrast the hair is washed at least once a week, and the face, hands, and feet once or twice each day. After she reaches the age of sixteen or seventeen a maiden must discipline her movements. No movement even in domestic labour must be hurried. She ought to walk with a slow and deliberate step. In the dance she must not lift her feet more than an inch or two from the ground. A girl who is seen running risks ridicule and a reputation for shamelessness. If, by evil chance, she were to fall backwards ‘with her legs in the air’ (□νάσκελα) she would virtually lose her honour. A girl should be proud but in a sense different from male pride. Thus she ought to be tall with an upright carriage, but with a gaze which is downcast, not level, and an expressive attitude which is directed inwards, not outwards. But old women are also feared. Knowledge of magic techniques and remedial procedures for the evil eye are attributed to them; and their curses are believed to be efficient ex opere operato. Where old women have a good name they use these skills in a socially approved manner to protect their families from spiritual dangers. But certain old women have a reputation for the evil and aggressive use of these powers. In these cases there are often allegations of dishonour in earlier life. A woman who surrenders to lust loses her soul to the Devil and remains his familiar. Envy is often the motive ascribed to her. Typically she is the woman accused of magically impairing a bridegroom's potency because he did not seek the hand of her own daughter. The attribution of envy often rests on valid [Page 291] grounds, for such women come, in the main, from families of low prestige and little material prosperity where difficulties in arranging honourable marriages are almost inevitable. Scandal which falsely questions the virtue of a maiden is believed to be particularly wicked. It may be easily achieved by only a few allusive remarks, whose author probably succeeds in remaining anonymous. For this reason, perhaps, it is strongly believed that God will punish those who spread lying scandals. [Page 292] Sometimes, however, the identity of a scandalmonger becomes known. John went to another village to catch a glimpse of the daughter of George Carvounis whom he was considering as a possible bride for his younger brother Demetrios. In the coffee-shop he casually mentioned the girl's name to Michael Goulas who, perhaps guessing the direction of the visitor's interest, told him that the girl was round-shouldered and absent-minded. At first John accepted this statement and without further delay returned to his home: but later he was persuaded by the marriage negotiator that he had been deceived, and after a further visit the marriage contract was eventually arranged. Goulas is relatively prosperous but already had a reputation for meanness and taciturnity. Even before this incident he was an infrequent visitor to the coffee-shop where he was careful to avoid any large gathering in whose company he might have to spend money. Meanness, envy, and unsociability form a pattern of qualities related in Sarakatsan thinking to evil and dishonour. The unsociable man is so because he has something to hide, he hides what he lacks, and what he lacks makes him envious of others. Meanness follows naturally upon envy. Had the poison of his scandal been effective, the crime of Goulas would probably never have become known. In the event, he was condemned and avoided by those who accepted John's version of the incident, and people did not hesitate to describe him as a man without honour (□τιμος). Conformity is the chief defence against denigration where people believe that the hostile criticism of others protects in some way their own reputation. Moreover the precision of this criticism is considerable since the social roles which a man or woman assumes at any period of life are few in number, and their implications are perfectly understood both by the protagonists and those who observe them. Yet it would be too simple a judgement to think that the concepts of honour and the honourable man depend only on the external sanctions of competition or mutual hostility. For the Sarakatsani believe that these ideals and values, which breathe meaning, purpose, and value into their lives, require no justification or sanction. They are a way of life, not a code of interdictions. The importance of constant self-assertion if a man is to hold his own in the coffee-shop oratory and boasting has already been mentioned. This is the necessary minimum for social reputation. But a successful display of pride demands something more. Here, the etymology of the word □περήϕανος, proud, is relevant. From □πέρ and ϕαίνομαι it is one who shows himself above his fellows. In displaying pride a man must behave in such a way as to show that he believes himself to be superior to other persons. It requires a suggestion of presumptuousness, a subtle air of arrogance, that suggests a man is dominating the gathering, and yet does not proceed as far as an insult or open challenge to others. It is an important element in prestige, but clearly it is also largely derivative from it. A poor man of inferior lineage or low prestige cannot give himself these airs without provoking ridicule. A man's self-regard is typically molested where he is insulted or defamed or believes himself to be so treated. When another person suggests by even indirect allusion that a man is dishonourable or weak he molests his self-regard (προαβάλλει τ□ν □υωϊσμό του). Or when a man by deed, or word, behaves towards another in such a way as to suggest that he is not worthy of consideration and recognition, he again molests his self-regard; for a man only acts in this way towards another when he considers him to be of lesser reputation and, by inference, less honourable. In such circumstances the core of a man's social personality is touched, his manliness and prepotence are questioned. Then, the only remedy is to attack his detractors with knife or stick. The laughter of other people is invited in all situations where a man, or a group, has failed. ‘The world laughs’ (□ κόσμος γελάει) at a man when he fails to defend his honour; for instance, when he does not reply to an affront. Equally, it laughs at him when he makes some slip in conventional behaviour, or when he is made to look ridiculous. It laughs at him if he does not adequately fulfil his social role. Conversely, the need to conform to social morality and etiquette is often supported by the statement that, if a man does not act in a particular way, ‘the world will laugh at him’. To be ridiculous (γελο□ος) is to lack the recognition essential for social reputation.",NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,NA,FEMALE,NA,NA,MALE,MALE,MALE,FEMALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,4d78cbf351,eh01-011,eh01
"Campbell, John Kennedy, and Philip Sherrard 1968 “Modern Greece” In Nations of the Modern World, 426 New York: Praeger https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=eh01-090","For any association between families unrelated by kinship or marriage these values had important implications. So exclusive were the obligations of members of the family to one another, so comprehensive were the consequences of the loss of honour, which was potentially at risk in dealings with outsiders, that distrust between unrelated families was virtually obligatory. Beyond the essentially negative prescriptions of neighbourly duty there was little sense of moral obligation. And since the preservation of social reputation depended on recognition unwillingly conceded by others, the denigration of other families, which might lead to their loss of prestige and even of honour itself, in a sense protected one's own position. The importance of name and reputation encouraged a man to much expressive boasting and self-assertion, for the need to equate the community's evaluation of himself with his own ideal image often encouraged a form of unconscious cheating, or self-deception. (Certainly, today, knives are pulled with greater bravado when it is certain that others are present to prevent their use.) It follows, too, that cleverness, skill, and cunning were prized because these were the capacities on which strength and success partly depended. Moreover, reputation was more easily preserved by families which had wealth and numbers of kinsmen and other clients to support them. In the court of honour strength was admired, weakness and poverty despised. The memoirs of Makriyannis show us his acute concern to justify his actions throughout his life in terms of the values of honour. A public whipping for a misdemeanour with a relative's gun was a searing and traumatic humiliation; yet a small fortune made through money-lending to hard-pressed farmers, and commercial deals in grain during a bread shortage which followed an outbreak of plague, is the object of self-congratulation because it saved him from an undignified dependence on others. For the intensity of responsibility and obligation to a restricted circle, and the extreme importance of honour and reputation which accompanied it, tended always to limit the range of moral obligation that a man could allow himself to feel. The extraordinary mosaic of heroism and self-seeking greed in the conduct of individual Greek leaders during the war of Independence is partly explicable in these terms. Reputation and power depended on followers, and the ability to hold followers on the means to support and pay them. Thus a man might too easily justify the methods he used to find these means. The temptation of personal and family advantage, and the priority that almost always was given to the settlement of personal slights and jealousies which in terms of honour were so consequential, continually threatened the unity of Greek military commands and the embryonic structures of civil administration; sometimes to the point of arrangements with the enemy. Where values were intrinsically self-regarding the margin which separated conduct that satisfied the reputation and interest of the individual, his family, and the community, from actions that were selfish in the dishonourable sense, was narrow and debatable. The priest is more often a native of the village and he is unlikely to be estranged from other villagers by superior education. He may have a wife, family, and fields of his own. But inevitably his ambiguous occupation as an intermediary between the community and God gives him a separate and ambivalent status. Villagers are disturbed by the contradiction that to make his own living he must charge, in addition to the salary paid to him by the Church, something for the blessings, liturgies, exorcisms, baptisms by which men draw upon the Grace and protection of God. In earlier times, before 1909, the priest was directly supported by his village through contributions of grain in a transaction which seemed more fitting and uncommercial. There is doubt, too, about the motives of a man who becomes a priest; on the one hand his office protects him from the competitive tests of manliness that other men must face; yet, on the other, he manipulates the symbols and forces of the spiritual life without himself having any marked ascetic obligations (the village clergy, for instance, are married), or personal virtues which distinguish him from ordinary men. Therefore the suspicion that priests may abuse their spiritual trust or social position persists; it is unlucky to meet one on a path, and scurrilous stories of adulterous priests are legion. A man reserves his respect for some old monk whose reputation for holiness is known, ‘who reads all day the Holy Book’, and it is to such a man that villagers may make their confession before the one or two occasions each year when they receive communion. They say they would not willingly do so to a village priest, and he in any case is only very rarely licensed by his bishop to hear confessions. Despite these ambiguities the villagers generally respect the office even if they are dissatisfied with the incumbent, and in those instances where a priest is upright and authoritative his influence in the village outside his strictly liturgical and sacramental role may be considerable.",NA,NEUTRAL,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,0dac8f79e9,eh01-090,eh01
"Campbell, John Kennedy 1992 “The Greek Hero” In Honor and Grace in Anthropology, 129–49 Cambridge: Cambridge University Press https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=eh01-016","Brigandage was endemic in the mountains of continental Greece throughout the period of Ottoman administration. The Greeks who engaged in this activity were generally young bachelors belonging to the mountain villages and transhumant shepherd communities in the area where they operated. They shared with the inhabitants of the mountains, who were also their principal victims, the same social values predicated on notions of honor, pride, and shame; and the same social institutions which protected the interests and reputation of the family. The role of the young unmarried man was that of the guardian and, if the need arose, the avenger of family honor. Indeed, as we shall see, involvement in an honor killing was one situation which might convert a young mountain villager or shepherd into a brigand. This category of young men, whether or not they became brigands, were expected to possess and display heroic qualities of courage and physical strength. It is these qualities and their attribution to brigands (or klephts as they were known), in the eighteenth century, that I wish to discuss. There is one fear, that the enemy will possess his body, despoil and desecrate it, and prevent his companions from giving him proper burial. Why does this matter? It matters because honor, like ritual, is principally a problem of external form and effect, not of intentions. Physical appearance, social decorum, the integrity of limits are constituents of it. Thersites, who speaks in a disorderly fashion throughout the poem, is appropriately ugly and physically deformed. To mutilate a dead body is to make it aeikes, unseemly, and therefore dishonored (Segal 1971: 15). The values of Homer's heroes, like any relatively consistent system of social norms, support an ordered pattern of relations. In the earlier part of the struggle for Troy the enemy dead, stripped of their arms, were returned to their own people for burial. The loss of armor, which is an extension of the warrior's personality and strikes terror into his opponents, is serious and dishonoring; hence the importance of closing ranks to defend the body of the fallen hero. But these aspects of death and defeat are tolerable if the hero is given a fitting burial. For this is a reaffirmation of his reputation by his equals; in the rituals of the burial, in the marking of his tomb and, for the foremost warriors, in the celebration of their name at funeral games which link it with feats of excellence. Later, however, the ordered exchange of dead warriors was threatened, first when Hector, incensed by Patroclus killing his brother Cebriones, tells the dying Patroclus that he will be treated as carrion, that the vultures will eat him. This intention provokes the furious battle over the dead man's body. Iris also tells Achilles that Hector intends to cut off Patroclus' head and fix it to a stake. The possibility that a defeated hero may be decapitated, or fed to dogs and birds, is an extension of unsanctioned violence which takes matters beyond accepted conventions. For the Homeric warrior it is a terrifying fate. The defilement of the corpse and the denial of burial represent a mark of dishonor which implies the extinction of the victim's name in the memory of this world and, in the world of the dead, a sentence of exile for the soul of the dead man which must wander eternally outside the gates of Hades. It follows that compassion also is a sentiment which is not acceptable in many contexts. Strength in body, followers, and resources is the prerequisite for survival in a warrior society. To be merciful is to be seen to be weak. Among the mountaineers from whom klephts were recruited, manliness is related to the notion of being varvatos, well endowed with testicles and the strength that is drawn from them. It contains an idea of ultimate ruthlessness and force that ought, however, to be disciplined to ideal ends if a man is to claim that he is honorable, philotimos. In normal practice gratuitous violence is not approved in this society, even among klephts. In transactions of vengeance, sheep theft, or the ransoming of captives, klephts moved cautiously and prudently, taking a life only when they had to. In the Iliad Achilles declares that before the death of Patroclus he preferred to spare Trojans when they fell into his hands alive. Nevertheless, in either society, when honor itself is at stake, all such considerations become secondary. We have seen how captives were executed without mercy if a ransom was not delivered. In all cases in the Iliad where supplicants beg for their lives in battle, their pleas are rejected. Agamemnon kills the two sons of Antimachus. He hews off the arms and head of one of them and sends his trunk rolling through the battle like a drum of stone. There is a fine line between the man of honor and the creature of [Page 147] frightfulness. Yet when a man appears in life or in legend who is unusually cruel or pitiless, as is the case with Agamemnon and certain of the klephtic captains, his honor is not compromised on that account. In the mountain society of villagers and shepherds the terror felt for such exceptional men was mixed with admiration. Honor, reputation, and family interests could be defended only by those who had the strength. Therefore, the display of physical force, of numbers of kinsmen and followers, of material wealth (particularly in animals) greatly impressed ordinary men, even when the claims and actions based on these resources were taken to excess.",NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,MALE,MALE,MALE,NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,MALE,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,988cbaa48d,eh01-016,eh01
"Dubisch, Jill 1986 “Introduction” In Gender & Power in Rural Greece, 3–41 Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=eh01-029","However, as useful as the private/public distinction might be in helping us to untangle the issues surrounding the exercise of power in Greek village life, we must be careful not to assume a simple isomorphism between gender roles and the domestic and public spheres. Even women's domestic roles, including their economic and religious roles, may have a public dimension (see, for example, Salamone and Stanton, this volume; Dubisch 1983; Hirschon 1983). Conversely, men can be seen as [Page 20] intrinsically connected to the house. Detailing how both men and women are engaged in a partnership that supports the house, du Boulay speaks of the “often tyrannous service to the house” to which men must submit in their constant struggles to support it. It is also important not to overlook the vital connections between the domestic and private arenas. We need to consider the ways that each supports and articulates with the other (for example, see Dimen, this volume), as well as the ways that power in one sphere is translated into power in the other sphere. Pavlides and Hesser point out in Chapter 4 that both the exterior façade and the interior furnishings of the village house serve to display a family's wealth and its women's industry. On occasions such as name day celebrations, there is a public “penetration” of the domestic sphere, in which the husband of the house presides as host over a table set in the saloni, “parlor”; both the room (the location of the family's best possessions) and the table laden with refreshments serve as public displays that uphold a family's communal reputation (see Danforth 1979b). In addition, as I have argued elsewhere (Dubisch 1974), the prestige of each partner, earned through appropriate behavior in his or her respective arenas, can translate into power in the other arena. A man granted respect by his wife at home gains prestige and influence in the public world; someone nagged by his wife, on the other hand, is pitied and looked down on. A women with a good reputation (reputation being by nature a public matter, based on community judgment) enjoys power and respect in her relations with her spouse.",NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,FEMALE,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,bb197c189b,eh01-029,eh01

A man's reputation does nevertheless depend upon his ability to live up to the expectations which he creates about himself. Davis (1969: 70–1) has argued that these expectations, which constitute ‘honour’, are a function of economic standing. But what of the disapproval meted out to the errant rich, or of the various ways in which ‘honour’ has been found in conditions of great poverty? In the Cretan village of ‘Glendi’ (see below), the definitive case of filotimo was held to be that of the desperately poor woman who provided unexpected guests with bread, a few olives and some water—a supremely humble offering, but acknowledged by all to be the best she could manage. In Vergadi (Peloponnese), again, a family's filotimo is not diminished if its female members work in the fields ‘when public opinion recognizes the necessity for it’ (Bialor 1973: 412). Each family tries to act according to a public evaluation of its current means, and it is success in this relative sense that filotimo conveys. The so-called egalitarianism of Mediterranean societies (and others as well) is thus a nominal equality of access to moral resources—the privilege, in Brögger's south Italian utopia, of all men. This public and relative aspect of moral evaluation is perhaps more strikingly evident in the negation of timi and filotimo. A Pefko field warden claimed that his absentee-landowner brother was lacking in filotimo because the latter would not pay him in cash for tending his vines. Actually, although brothers do engage in commercial relations in the extremely fragmented social nexus of Pefko, ‘lack of filotimo’ is not something which a man who himself possessed filotimo would attribute to his immediate kin before outsiders. It was thus consistent for the field warden to be regarded as a notorious grousouzis—a co-villager who nevertheless lacked the ordinary decency meant by filotimo. Here lies the rub: atimia, the definitive and total absence of filotimo, is something which may only be attributed to outsiders—criminals, Turks, political enemies, and in some contexts, non-kin within the community, but most certainly never one's own brother! The warden, by thus inverting normative usage, was living up to his unenviable reputation as a grousouzis—one who is ‘without luck’ (Turkish uˇgursız), hence a socially polluting agent of misfortune, a morally defective insider.

It may be hard to escape imputations of grusuzia, but no Pefkiot willingly admits to being endowed with it, although some seem careless or inept in repressing various personal signs that others might interpret as indicating grusuzia; this presumably demonstrates a degree of insensitivity or indifference and has the effect of enhancing an already negative reputation. In such cases, grusuzia evokes hostility; only when others do not feel endangered by it, as in the case of the war victim (case 4), can imputations of grusuzia truly be said to lack any overtones of real hostility. At the most general level, grusuzia is the state of being in which one has no acceptable social identity. This is not the same as having no individual personality; after all, grusuzia can be called a bad fisiko or character trait.

"Herzfeld, Michael 1985 The Poetics of Manhood: Contest and Identity in a Cretan Mountain Village Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=eh01-051","Instead, what we see here is a complete identification. The narrator, imbued with a notion of selfhood that defines identity in terms of continuity in the male line, lamented an encapsulating death—one in which he, his father, his grandfather (the actual protagonist), and indeed all possible ancestors in the same line, are fused into a single identity. He never knew his grandfather, who was slain almost two decades before his own birth, just as another Glendiot who took the life of his brother's killer had never known his brother. In the case of vengeance killing, one might argue that social pressure would make such direct contact with the deceased irrelevant: the shame of failing to “take the blood back” would be sufficient incentive to do so. But this misses the point of a patrilineal ideology in which the inheritance of selfhood in the male line means that the deaths of one's agnates are wounds of the self. The old man who so profusely lamented his grandfather's heroic demise had also inherited his grandfather's baptismal name, and the fact that the grandfather had died fighting for an independence that was at once Glendiot, Cretan, and Greek gave special poignancy to the identification. In his own day, the grandson had acquired a fearsome reputation as an animal thief, and had then also fought against the German invaders and served as village president. In reciting the story of his grandfather's death, he brought together the various strands of the poetics of Glendiot manhood. It also evokes an unambiguously active condition: the kala 'ndras is not one who rests on his laurels, but one who continues to earn them. Thus, performance is essential to the maintenance of a worthwhile reputation among Glendiot men. A truly gifted performer may win kudos for sheer nerve, as when he invites policemen to sit down with him to a meal of the meat of the animals that he has just stolen. On other occasions, a sudden reversal may call for admiration: a man whose anger is backed by real influence (kozi, “knuckle”) drops his voice to one of bored reproach, thereby humiliating his lesser rival all the more effectively. Improvisation is at a premium, and a good performer will make sure that his audience realizes that he is indeed improvising, or—in a sheep-theft narrative, for example—did so in the actions of which he now boasts. The ability to play with the conventions in aesthetically intriguing ways, and above all to seize opportunity from unpromising materials, is what generates simasia in particular contexts. Much of this book is an extended illustration of that principle. Fighting one's close agnates, by contrast, represents an abandonment of true manhood. In striking ways, it bears a structural resemblance to incest. It entails social reciprocities (sinallayes) of kinds thought to be especially immoral between close kin; it consequently besmirches the [Page 77] reputation of the village as a whole, as well as that of the patrigroup concerned; and it leaves its wounds open: the incestuous couple cannot marry, and the estranged agnates, especially if brothers, are unlikely to become ritual kin (sindekni) as well. The theoretical expectation that a father will take the lives of both a daughter and a son caught in incestuous union lends force to the analogy between incest and internecine violence: Glendiots call revenge “taking the blood back” (na yirisi to ema piso) and incest “blood mixing” (emomiksia). Villagers, using the rhetoric of modernity, say that the successful detection of stolen livestock requires both psychology and diplomacy. “Psychology” here means the ability to deduce who is likely to have stolen the missing animals in the light of known quarrels or previous incidents, as well as of reputation as a successful thief. “Diplomacy” means the successful manipulation of existing ties, and especially the ability to coax a confession out of a recalcitrant sindeknos or other associate. One of the Glendiots' favorite instances of the latter talent concerns not animal theft, but murder, although the incident is taken to illustrate the cunning that supposedly characterizes shepherds above all others. A Glendiot had been thrown into jail along with several others on suspicion of their being collectively involved in a murder. The Glendiot, who knew perfectly well who the killer was but did not want to take the responsibility of reporting him, kept fuming, “I screw the mother of the man who committed this murder!” Eventually the murderer could stand it no longer, and screamed at the Glendiot to cease his insults—and the guard overheard the whole exchange. All but the true murderer were then released, and the tale is still told in Glendi as an illustration of the cunning diplomacy in which the shepherds are so expert. Again, the boy whose mother was insulted in the incident over the spilled acorns tried for a long time to escape detection, since the longer he could maintain his incognito the more damage he could inflict. To his mother he was especially careful to give nothing away, both because he knew that she would be displeased at his exposing himself to such danger and because, apparently, he wanted the satisfaction and benefits of inflicting revenge for himself alone:I used to avoid [doing anything obvious], that is, but I'd be looking for a chance. I'd be sitting here in the coffeehouse up to ten or eleven o'clock, making like I was going home to sleep, and I['d] go by the house to tell my mother, “Mother, I'm going up to the [Page 199] mountainside tonight, and not staying here. I'm going over there to see how the sheep are doing.”I'd go on up, I'd go and take his animals and slaughter one, and fix up the meat and hide it, and chuck the rest into the ravine, and in the morning I'd show up, so to speak, with the sheep, herding them in that direction.From the [early] evening I'd be here, the same in the morning, and every evening again I'd come back down here.They couldn't find me out, I tell you.I didn't do anything else.People would say, “If Eftikhis [the speaker] were going to take the sheep off him, he'd take, for example, Manolis or Mikhalis—someone else. On his own, what could he do?” (Did you understand?) “No meat's been found on him, what would he do with them [i.e., the animals]?”Once he was forced by his uncle to confess, his success in keeping the secret for so long redounded to his credit, and contributed to his rapidly established reputation as a skilled and cunning opponent. This is not to say that patrigroup fission is based entirely on aesthetic principles. Rather, to revert to the point I made earlier about the artificiality of distinguishing between moral and aesthetic values, a man's excellence—his eghoismos—is known only through the performance he provides of his selfhood. His acquisition of a nickname is a test of his ability to overcome the constraints imposed by his inner sense of dropi, and thereby to demonstrate that excellence; as it becomes more widely known and used, it also becomes a mark of his success in that regard. Only a man who has developed a strong reputation, one aspect of which is to have sired many sons, can expect to found a new segment. Thus, the progression from anonymity to distinctive identity, and from dropi over a caustic nickname to proud display, is the definitive career of the “man of knuckle” and potential segment founder.",NA,MALE,NA,MALE,NA,MALE,MALE,MALE,NA,MALE,NA,NA,MALE,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,cf5592857f,eh01-051,eh01

Upkeep and care of dwellings were of a consistently high standard (Plates 7 and 8). Although the houses were not of solid construction they have endured continuous occupation for over fifty years; clearly any neglect by their occupants would soon have resulted in abject slum conditions. This can be explained only by the strength of cultural values, particularly the central importance of house and family, the power of neighbourhood opinion, and the housewife's role in maintaining the home environment. Considerable time and energy was expended on maintenance, particularly by the woman, whose reputation was assessed in terms of her housekeeping abilities. Walls and shutters were painted twice a year before the major religious festivals of Easter and Christmas, while details such as steps, flower pots, even lamp-posts and pavement edges, were whitewashed by the more diligent every few weeks (Hirschon 1985). Despite the refugees' uncertainty about their future in the early days, the dashing of their hopes for a return to their homeland, and their disillusionment at their subsequent treatment, and despite their later sense of dependence and impotence in Greek society, they did not neglect the areas of primary concern—the house, the family, their immediate community. The strength of these three major elements in the cultural heritage of the disadvantaged urban refugees provided the basis for building a new way of life from the old. Social reputation, closely bound up with mourning observances in general, is also involved in concern for the condition of the grave itself over an extended period of mourning. For the housewife therefore the grave demands continual attention just as her home does. In popular usage the grave is called ‘the last residence’ (η τελευταία κατοικία), the home of the deceased person for a three-year period. The cemetery is in a sense a residential locality demanding effort and upkeep as does the home area of each family (cf. Danforth 1982: 133). Here too the critical eyes of neighbours assess the competence of each family. But in Kokkinia the grave is not simply a ‘domestic extension’ for the housewife. Because the position of graves in the local cemetery is not related to neighbourhoods or home location, the cemetery is primarily a public and communal space. It serves a large densely populated area including several municipalities besides Kokkinia. The significance of this for women whose [Page 218] duty it is to serve the dead, lies in their acceptable public role (see Chapter 10).",NA,NA,NA,FEMALE,FEMALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1f8e049f74,eh01-058,eh01

For Greeks a woman's ability as a housewife is of paramount importance and is an indicator of a married woman's prestige and reputation. The first major criterion by which a wife is judged is her proficiency in maintaining cleanliness and order in and around the house. Diligence and hard work are highly valued, while laziness is abhorred, for it results in the neglect, dirtiness and disorder of the home. The emphasis on the creation and preservation of harmony is a theme which recurs in the ideals associated with womanhood. It is most clearly defined with respect to her housekeeping ability. A somewhat extreme case illustrates the fundamental importance of this criterion: a young man divorced his wife after a year of marriage because ‘she was not a good housekeeper, she was dirty’ (then itan kali noikokyra, glitsou itan). This reason was given by people who had known the couple, and by his close family. They never criticised the girl's character — indeed they all agreed that she had a ‘good heart’ (kali psychi). He remarried, and the second wife proved to be highly competent in the home.

The competition does not exist between kamakia, but implicitly between them and men of other classes. Lower-class men are better kamakia than upper-class men, who cannot really compete. In general, men who have high social status in Platanos would not make kamaki within the town, as they fear for their reputation; there are no known upper-class kamakia. Similarly, married men normally have a need for secrecy and discretion, and both these categories of men are more likely to make kamaki outside the town. In contrast, men who use the activity as a prestige system are usually members of some sort of team or partnership, and they are more obvious and keener to declare themselves. A substantial element in the game is sociability with other kamakia and the public declaration of one's occupation; thus, in this paper, I have felt justified in leaving out (and perhaps not knowing some of) the more marginal players. A man from a different social milieu would also have difficulty in joining a parea of players. One educated man (who had been to a university) joined some kamakia friends to meet tourist women and was criticized for his conversational technique with women: “You don't screw with books” (dhen gamas me vivlia).

Any attempt to construct a model of the spatial organization of an Indian trapping economy, therefore, must be tempered by the realization that economic and industrial location theory has been severely handicapped by its dependence upon classical notions of efficiency, maximization, and optimization. Increasingly, location theorists are turning their attention to behavioral models in an attempt to account for the role of the nonrational individual actor and decision-maker in locational processes (Pred and Kibel, 1970; Gould, 1970). The Chipewyan demonstrate that locational processes can be molded by a rationality of another cultural persuasion. Indeed, the fact that fur trapping has all but disappeared in many subarctic Indian communities in recent years underscores its persistence among the southern Chipewyan.

Their prime overt purpose was to transfer a chief's privileges to his children. At various periods of their lives he gave a potlatch in a child's honor to announce that he or she was assuming a new name and new rights (seats, dances, properties). The potlatch thus served as a device for transferring hereditary property. It was an invariable concomitant of the Shamans' Dance, which, as will be seen, served the same end. The commonest reasons for potlatching were as follows: Life crises (birth, puberty, marriage, death), minor critical stages (wife's pregnancy, child's first tooth, first game, when some accident befell the child), or sometimes for no very obvious reason at all, except just to be giving one. There was no competitive potlatching of the Kwakiutl variety: “You couldn't fight or quarrel in a potlatch. That would give a bad name to your child, and be a disgrace to your whole family.” All chiefs were expected to give potlatches, and anyone else who was able.

By giving potlatches the honor, prestige, social rank, reputation, and so on of host, household, and clan were raised. A great potlatch might almost bankrupt the host and his whole clan, but the maintenance or raising of prestige was regarded as well worth the time, expense, and effort. It should be emphasized that no one could gain wealth by potlatching. The surplus (foodstuffs, goods, and money) represented things acquired through trading, working, and so on. All might be splurged on a single potlatch. There could be no monetary or material gain. The only gain was purely social. The host, his household, and his clan gained in esteem and social prestige and thereby in social rank. All guests, regardless of age, sex, or social rank were feasted and received gifts. Of these only a few, those of high rank, would ever give return potlatches and the food and goods these commoners received were therefore “wasted” in the economic sense. Those guests who would give return potlatches were in the same position. For a host the return feastings and gifts he would receive would always be far less in amount than the amount he had expended.

Bravery and generosity appear to have been essential. The ethnographers differ in their ordering of exploits by which a reputation for bravery was established, but all agree that war honors were ranked, and that the killing and scalping of an enemy ranked below the more dangerous feats of successfully wresting the weapons from an enemy and escaping without injury, or stealing into the center [Page 46] of an enemy encampment and making off with a fine horse that had been tethered to its owner’s tepee. Bravery was measured, then, according to the relative danger of the exploit and the most dangerous deeds were those related to war and raiding. But brave deeds alone were not enough. Unless a man were generous with his goods and helpful to his neighbors, he would be branded as selfish and stingy and his supporters might abandon him. This emphasis put stress on acquiring property with which to be generous which in turn made skill important. But all these traits were enhanced if a man had supernatural support. Power increased a man’s self-confidence and the expectancy of success on the part of himself and others. Ewers remarked that the horse raider “... was a courageous, alert, resourceful fighting man.

The íExtsewicè wore each two sashes of red flannel crossing in front. If the Crow were fleeing from the enemy, the sash-wearers were permitted to run with the other men. But just as soon as they heard a fellow-tribesman utter a cry for help, they were obliged to turn back and rush to the rescue at the risk of their lives. They either surrendered their horses to the endangered comrades or took them up behind themselves, or turned their horses loose and fought in defense of their friends. The naxpitsé ih□'rupte wore a belt of bearskin with the legs and claws left on. If the Crow were victorious, no special duties devolved on him. But if the Crow were being pursued, it was his duty immediately to descend from his horse and attempt to arrest the progress of the pursuers. If he ran with the rank and file, someone was sure to cry, “Get off!” Then he must dismount and stand. Should he have persisted in fleeing in spite of this admonition and succeeded in making his escape, he was thenceforth treated as a coward and outcast, regardless of his former reputation. The belt-wearer painted his body with mud and bunched up his hair in imitation of a bear's ears. This officer almost always lost his life in battle. When the society performed its dance, the belt-wearer remained seated, thus indicating that he would not run away in an engagement. As soon as his mate, the akbíretsirixī□e, saw him seated, he rushed towards him and whipped him in order to make him rise.

Retired warriors with powerful spirit guardians [Page 167] constituted an elite which shaped the careers of young men by offering counsel and the protective influence of supernatural power—for a fee. A warrior-medicine-man often dreamed of locating the enemy and perceived foes bested in combat, the necessary precondition for success. This information and blessing were conveyed to a protegé, usually a near relative, son-in-law, or friend of his own son. Such dreams often were quite specific with regard to details. Speaking of the dreams with which Sees-The-Living-Bull blessed him, Two Leggings (Nabakov 1967:166) reported:… The events he foretold always came true. He had given me his medicine and now he gave me his dreams and visions which brought me many victories as the summers and winters passed.The reputations of great men thus were sprinkled profusely with “miracles”—the timely prophesy of the enemy's fate at the hands of an avenging Crow warrior, the drawing of buffalo to the camp, or the raising or driving away of rain clouds. Such men drew others about them, as Iron Bull, whose sister's sons ate at his table daily and rode his fine horses in exchange for their care. Iron Bull also generously fed a number of old men in his lodge daily, supplying the meat through his own skill as a hunter (Curtis 1970:4:51). While the principle of reciprocity was the keystone of Crow social relationships and cooperation, the exercise of public rights must be validated by either reputation or “purchase.” Commonly those of reputation were invited to carry out important ceremonial functions, and these tasks required some gift in payment for the service. The linkage between a successful career and social reciprocities between in-laws was especially vital to the social order. The most direct route to public reputation and influence was through warfare. Success in war not only confirmed supernatural patronage but also provided horses, the prime measure of wealth and the prized gift in social repayments. A distribution of wealth in public “give-aways” reinforced and extended reputation since the individual fulfilled his social obligations and proclaimed that prized virtue, generosity. Husband and wife share the heavier burden in accumulating goods to honor a son with a “give-away,” with the wife's maternal relatives secondarily obligated for substantial amounts. A modest “give-away” will cost around $800 and the more prestigeful several thousands of dollars. Adoption into the Tobacco Society (Beaver Dance) takes between $4,000 and $5,000. In a $2,000 give-away, a father would be expected to contribute about $200. The more prestigeful and costly the items distributed, the more reputation increases. Decorated boots, saddles, and serapes obtained from Old Mexico are more esteemed than locally purchased items. Inflation has pressured expenditures upward. For example, when Crow give a handcrafted and beaded buckskin dress, they are honoring the person with a gift of about $700. At the same time status [Page 174] competition has driven up expectations. Thus, to reciprocate the honoring of one's sister with a give-away by her husband's kin, a brother will strive for a “give-away” in which he can give his brother-in-law a race horse with registered papers (Voget, Crow Field Notes).",NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,1098fbc934,nq10-028,nq10

I believe that some Hopis found witchcraft involved in the misfortunes of the principal, though this is difficult to prove from the data I collected. Just after I arrived in the field, a Hopi policeman was set upon and badly beaten by three Navajos whom he was trying to arrest. An unfortunate train of circumstances led to the Navajos getting the drop on the policeman, who was armed, experienced in arresting aggressive men, and working with a partner. I believe that Hopis would argue that with luck he would have completed the arrest unharmed, and that bad luck may be due to witchcraft. Actually, I did not hear this argument made explicitly, although I thought it implicit in some informants' descriptions of the beating. One informant, for example, started his description of the event with the phrase, “------------'s days are numbered, you know.” I do not insist on this interpretation, however. Informants did point out, at any rate, that many Hopis (and Navajos) had little good feeling for the policeman. As Aberle (1967:134) points out, hostile thoughts are themselves dangerous to others. I earlier cited a Hopi Superintendent to the effect that: “If a resident acquires the reputation of being unreasonable and unfeeling, as a policeman often must, his standing in the outraged community may affect all other phases of his life” (Leo Crane, cited by Dozier, 1966:27).",NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3364e3f9bd,nt09-012,nt09

It should be remembered that Don is not a weakling but one of the largest and strongest men in Oraibi, and possesses sufficient strength and stamina to administer punishment to an insolent half-grown son. Furthermore, he is not a tenderfoot. In childhood he was regarded as “tough” and one of the “meanest” boys in the village. At his initiation into the Katcina society, he stood a usual whipping [Page 403] without a whimper, broke down only when the flogging was more than doubled, and has since been proud of the scars which resulted from that ordeal. In the Agency school he was slapped for pulling the ears of a Navaho lad, had his mouth washed with soap for talking too much, stood in the corner of the classroom for misbehavior, and was soundly spanked for imitating Christ. Later at Sherman he deliberately chose to be lashed with a rawhide, and with his trousers down, in preference to debating in public. He has the reputation for horseplay in clowning and has been willing to run about in the plaza with cactus dangling between his bare legs and against his back and chest, and to have the thorns broken off in his flesh. Don also has fighting propensities. As a boy he was in constant conflict with others, particularly his elder brother, and was “nearly killed” by him. He bought a revolver with the first money he ever earned. After marriage he threw a stick at his wife on one occasion and slapped her on another. He wrestles with gods and spirits in his dreams. And he is hardly a coward. As a young man he crawled into the den of a wounded coyote, and once chased a Navaho thief for three days to regain his stolen horse, a feat which few Hopi will dare attempt. He can bury the dead and drive dogs and coyotes from fresh graves at night. He has taken offerings to the shrine of Masau'u in the dead of night, and repeated this performance, although terribly frightened by the god of death. He asserts that he could spend the night in a white man's cemetery: “I would place a little food on each grave, ask the spirits to do me no harm, lie down, and snore like a hog.” He has a reputation for courage in Oraibi and is very proud of it. He once seized a prominent missionary by the lapel of his coat and ordered [Page 404] him out of his mother's house.

He had good relations with successive agency superintendents, and as sometime agency employee (variously “Judge,” “Laborer,” “Policeman”), he acted as an intermediary with several Hopi leaders. In January 1913 he was appointed Bacavi's agency policeman (Crane 12-20-1912). Duties included the controversial program of getting Hotevilla children into school, at which, owing to his fearsome supernatural reputation, he was very effective. This office lasted for a few years only, but he continued to identify with it by wearing the police uniform until the end of his life. Moreover, Kewanimptewa, as noted, was clairvoyant and a prophet. These abilities (still recognized in the 1980s throughout Third Mesa's older population), combined with his reputation for fearlessness associated with membership of the One-Horn society, endowed Kewanimptewa with a far-reaching charismatic authority. He is remembered as a leader who took farsighted measures for change which would have been intimidating to most. Fear of group criticism is a generally effective restriction on radical action in Hopi society; those who can withstand this and promulgate radical policies are exceptional. Kewanimptewa was thus a powaqa—in the positive sense, as someone with extraordinary abilities to manipulate the course of events, to his supporters, and negatively, as a witch, to his detractors. The following are representative consultants' quotations: [Page 215]
Even when they first settled in Hotevilla, Kewanimptewa began to talk about what he envisioned happening.
I can never understand how Kewanimptewa knew about the life today. How and from where did he know all this?
All of what people say about Kewanimptewa leads me to believe that he was indeed a powaqa [in the sense of clairvoyant].
One thing Kewanimptewa always said to me was that he was not afraid to admit he was a powaqa. He already understood the white man's way and that's why he was not afraid to visit or to live it.

A keen mind and steady head were considered the most necessary, and, despite the Apache's past reputation for a life of marauding, war or hunting prowess alone were not sufficient to fit a man for chief. Above all, a chief must have the interests and safety of his people at heart. The obligation of a chief to help his people is illustrated in the custom, still in use, of calling anyone from whom a special favor is desired “my chief.” Not only is it a compliment, but to refuse the request under such conditions can be considered boorish. One old man in describing the qualities necessary in a chief said:A chief was chosen because he usually had the biggest farm and was the richest man of his clan in the locality. Also, he was picked because he had the largest number of relatives. A man without a family would not be made a chief. Besides these things, he must be the best talker, fear nothing, have keener wits, and do more than any other man. He must be a man who would not run, even if he saw a bear coming after him.

But leadership of the chiefs is extraneous to the structure of the dance, which has its own specific leadership. Song-leaders [454] are called baiango. Generally there are not more than two or three of these men with a wide reputation in a tribe. A man who wishes eventually to become a baiango or song-leader will first have to serve an apprenticeship with one of these men, to whom he will act as suali. A song-leader’s suali come to the dances at which he is singing and they stand opposite to him or at his side and back up the choruses. These suali soon get to know all their leaders’ songs and when he is not present they take his place. Precedence is given to the chief suali of a noted song-leader and to-day they are sometimes denoted by Arabic terms referring to ranks in the government police -- sergeant, corporal, and lance-corporal. The dance, like all joint activities, necessarily generates leadership, the function of which is to organize the activity. The problem of the allotment of roles in the dance is solved by the introduction of status. In the event of quarrels it is the song-leader who arbitrates. When food or beer is provided it is given to him for distribution.

"Evans-Pritchard, E E (Edward E (1937) Witchcraft, oracles and magic among the Azande Retrieved from https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=fo07-071","Not every one who displays these unpleasant traits is necessarily regarded as a witch, but it is these sentiments and modes of behaviour which make people suspicious of witchcraft, so that Azande know that those who display them have the desire to bewitch, even if they do not possess the power to do so. Since it is these traits which antagonize neighbours against those who show them it is their names which are most frequently placed before the oracles when the neighbours fall sick, and they are therefore likely to be accused frequently of witchcraft and to acquire a reputation as witches. Witches tend to be those whose behaviour is least in accordance with social demands. For though Azande do not consistently think of neighbours who have once or twice bewitched them as witches, some people are so frequently exposed by oracles that they gain a sustained reputation for witchcraft and are regarded as witches outside specific situations of misfortune. Those whom we would call good citizens—and, of course, the richer and more powerful members of society are such—are seldom accused of witchcraft, while those who make themselves a nuisance to their neighbours and those who are weak are most likely to be accused of witchcraft. Tupoi had a great failing for beer and invariably seemed to get news when I intended to give a pot or two of beer to my retainers and neighbours, and, though uninvited, he would as invariably make his appearance at the party. I found this so annoying that I strictly forbad beer to be given to him. I was not obeyed, and on inquiry I was told that no one was prepared to take the risk of passing round a gourd and leaving Tupoi out, since he was undoubtedly a witch and would harm any one who so insulted him. Yet in spite of Tupoi’s reputation no one would insult him by calling him a witch, save in great anger, nor would any one mention this opinion to Tupoi’s friends. Seances are held when a householder has suffered some misfortune. It may be asked why in these circumstances he does not consult one of the oracles in private rather than go to the trouble of summoning several practitioners to a more expensive public performance, especially, as we shall see later, since other oracles are generally considered to be more reliable as sources of revelation than witch-doctors, and since he will in any case have to ask them for a confirmation of a witch-doctor’s utterances before he can act upon them. The reason may be that public seances increase the social prestige of a householder who initiates them, and that revelations of witch-doctors have a peculiar social value in that, although considered more liable to error than several other oracles, they have the special advantage which an open investigation gives in delicate personal matters. Moreover, the witch-doctor functions at these seances not only as an oracular agent but also as a fighter against witch-craft, so that he can not only tell a person in which direction he must look for the witch who is injuring him and what steps he may take to counteract the influence of witchcraft, but also by his dances he wages immediate war on witches and may succeed in driving them from his patient, so that, by showing them he is aware of their identity they are scared for ever from his homestead. But I believe that the first of these reasons, the desire to enhance one’s reputation by giving a public entertainment, is the most important. To those present a seance is a very good show which is amusing to watch, now and again exciting, and always provides material for comment and gossip for a long [Page 164] time afterwards. To the master of the homestead it is a means of finding out who is troubling his welfare; of warning the witch, who is probably present in person at the seance, that he is on his tracks; and of gaining public support and recognition in his difficulties, and esteem and publicity by throwing open his house to the country-side and by employing performers. Bögwözu accompanied his reforms with extravagant boasts about his reputation and his aristocratic clients, boasts which were probably untrue, since I later met two of these clients and both denied his claims. His demand for fees was unceasing. Shortly after he had cooked medicines for his colleagues at a special meeting convened for this purpose, I returned to my hut and wrote an account of what I had particularly noticed about his behaviour. His prestige does not depend so much on the practice of his craft as on his personal reputation in it. To-day there are many practitioners, but few attain eminence. Fame is not, moreover, based solely on restricted professional knowledge of the witch-doctor’s art, in its aspects of divination and leechcraft, but also on the fact that a noted witch-doctor is generally also a noted magician in other respects. Many of those who practise as witch-doctors also possess powerful magic of other kinds, such as bagbuduma, vengeance-magic, and iwa, the rubbing-board oracle. People may possess all kinds of magic without at the same time being witch-doctors, but the witch-doctor is essentially the magician of Zande society, the repository of all sorts of medicines.

First, laymen rationalize the debtera ’s abinet knowledge around his putative demon familiars, and the lay distinction between the different kinds of debtera magicians (the minor debtera, tinish debtera, and the demon-puller, ganel sabiy) rests on a man’s ability to call familiars. In actuality, demon-pulling does not appear to be a way of learning other kinds of abinet nor is it necessary in order for other abinet to be effective. A reputation as a demon-puller does give advantages to a debtera, for it guarantees fair-dealing by colleagues in exchanges of abinet and it advertises the extent and sophistication of the demon-puller’s abinet capital. Of these advantages the layman knows nothing. Second, laymen describe debtera as spoiled priests, men who have been driven from their natal parishes because of their sinning. The debtera takes an ironical view of this misconceived belief because it assumes that a man who is willing to settle down to the life of a farmer-priest is made of the intellectual and temperamental stuff necessary for enduring the prolonged rigors of the debtera ’s education. One must look beyond this argument, however, to explain how any particular debtera communicates and confirms his claims to special powers. When a secular healer inherits a therapy he also inherits a professional reputation, which grows gradually as his public becomes aware that the disease name specialty and the right to practice it have been transmitted to him, generally by a senior kinsman. The situation is very different for a debtera, since the abinet that he acquires are “anonymous.” Without the kinship and parish networks that his secular counterpart enjoys, the debtera must establish his healing abilities for his public de novo . To this public, the debtera is an anonymous and mysterious figure. During the first two decades of his professional life, he is continually on the move, pursuing studies from master to master and travelling from one unremunerative and confining ecclesiastical position to another, gradually acquiring a commercially adequate abinet repertoire and realizing his ecclesiastical goals. Only later does he settle down as a master ( memher ) with his own coterie of students. He establishes himself in a town, where he can receive clients in confidence, free from the conventional morality and inquisitive eyes of parish folk, and where he can maximize his public. With his magic he enables merchants to best rival tradesmen, helps the proprietors of beer house and mead hall [Page 261] to attract customers and to upset rival establishments, assists minor functionaries to win the favor of their superiors, and makes it possible for litigants to beguile their judges. In addition, he draws clients from among the hundreds and even thousands of peasants who are drawn to the town’s weekly market, its churches, and its fleshpots. As we have already seen, while the professional reputation of a secular healer is discontinuous in that his public believes that his success in any disease episode is proof only of healing power relevant to that ailment, laymen perceive the debtera ’s reputation in terms of generic power. Each of the debtera ’s successes proves his ability to accomplish other kinds of works which he has not yet performed for his public. A successful cure or prophylaxis against one named disease is regarded as evidence of his ability to cure successfully other ailments, or to prevent other contingencies, or to divine or bring about nonmedical events. Thus, while herbalists are distinguished from one another along two dimensions, healing power and disease name specialty, debtera are distinguished along the dimension of differential power alone.",NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,9f9d3a3570,mp05-017,mp05

Moreover, to a man who had been accustomed to a life of action, the scene in Buganda was no longer exciting. The mutual growth of understanding between Kaggwa and Mugwanya and the complete readiness of the Catholic top hierarchy to collaborate, made Kaggwa leave Mugwanya in charge of affairs in Buganda. So far as the Protestant establishment was concerned, the vast majority of its members saw their future as inseparably linked with that of the colonial regime and this earned them the ill-will of the king. Dissent towards the colonial regime was uncommon unless it was against certain individuals.

These were originally the personal names of some distinguished ancestor who made a reputation for himself by killing a lion, or many enemies, or being a distinguished shorokta, and so on, but these men are not poqalla. We saw earlier that at Buso in about 1600 the Bamalle had begotten the Xrele family, who in turn had begotten the Teeana, [Page 173] Bulgo, Laha, and other families. As a result, men have in fact three names. So my friend who was usually known as Katano Bulgo was really Katano Orano Bulgo, and his father, old aaka (grandfather) Bulgo, was really Orano Kahano Bulgo. The rule of name inheritance is therefore that the son takes as his second name his father's first name. This is a very common system of name inheritance around the world, but it is to some extent obscured by the presence of the third, family, name – in this case that of Bulgo. (It was the custom of family names that led me astray in the first edition. There, pp. 100–101, I stated that the sons of eldest sons took their father's second name, while the sons of younger sons took their father's first name. While this is a very elegant system, and would account for the persistence of the poqalla name over the generations, it happens to be wrong, and all sons take their father's first name as their second name.).

On inquiring what it was about I was told that they were joking with one elderly man, who had the reputation of being something of a sakoota, and saying that they would take him out into the fields and rape him. This sort of occasion, the conduct of the transvestites, and the long periods of sexual abstinence that are required after their wives have given birth, lead one to suppose that they may seek relief among themselves in homosexual intercourse on occasion. But this is not to say it is approved of, and there is no doubt that for them such a form of sexual relationship is sterile, unnatural, and hence deplorable.

Corresponding to their position with 'Ng ai, they are distinguished by a relative peaceableness.

"Spencer, P (1988) The Maasai of Matapato: a study of rituals of rebellion In International African library (pp [xiv], [297]) Retrieved from https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=fl12-020","Merero was in the forefront of an attack on a cornered lion and speared it fatally. Before he could follow through his action, someone else grabbed the tail. Merero insisted that he alone had fought the lion and this entitled him to the mane. His threats led the manyata and then the elders to intervene to avoid bloodshed. With increasing pressure, other Terito R moran persuaded him that his role in the hunt and his reputation for courage were widely known, and it was pointless to bring the patrons' curse on himself. He deferred to this pressure, vowing that he would spear the very next lion. That night, so it is claimed, a massive lion sprang into a village nearby and attacked a cow, and it was Merero who killed it on the spot and seized the tail. So it was that while the manyata girls were still sewing the first mane into a trophy headdress, Merero provided them with a second magnificent mane for himself. When the Terito age-set became firestick patrons in due course, they recalled this episode to emphasise the effectiveness of their blessing over moran who deferred to the popular will. Not all especially brave moran became or wanted to become diehards. They had a bleak reputation that repelled many. It was not simply that they were killjoys at any gathering, dour and uncommunicative; but also that they were notorious for showing no quarter, killing mercilessly, and wholly lacking in discretion and moderation. At considerable personal risk, they heightened the probability of military success. But they also increased the vicious hostility, and lowered the chances that enemies of the Maasai would show any mercy when the tables were turned. The diehards associated with the Meto manyata in Matapato, for instance, are remembered as having pursued a party of Kamba raiders from the east who had crossed their territory after seizing cattle in Loodokilani. The story recounts the feat of endurance that led them to recover all the cattle; but instead of being merely satisfied with this clear victory, they pursued the raiders into their homeland determined to kill every one of them. A similar argument links the extremes of the axis of constraint, where individuals can find themselves torn between total involvement and forlorn isolation, reminiscent of a crisis in a love relationship. An experience of this kind is related in Case 36 by a moran forced to ‘drink milk’ by himself as a step towards elderhood. This precipitated an emotional crisis with his age mates and seemed part of a more general threat to the age-group itself. Similarly, the unity of a successful raid in the past (2nd quadrant) could be shattered by fierce rivalry for sharing the spoil on returning home (1st). Again, the ambivalent reputation of the diehards ranged between supremely altruistic loyalty (2nd) and the roguish vanity of their obsession with personal reputation (1st). Again, the ambivalent reputation of boys is the uncertainty of whether they will submit to the herding regime over the years (4th) or will react as wastrels, throwing away their chances (3rd). There is another enturuj avoidance between husband and wife that has to be resolved as their marriage consolidates. Neither should touch the other's head, and until this avoidance is relaxed, senior moran have to [Page 177] solicit each other's wives often in other villages to shave their scalps. At first, this may be an acceptable aspect of sharing their wives' services or displaying their hair as moran. However, the ideal for an aspiring elder is to display self-sufficiency by being shaved regularly in his own village; and this can only be done after his senior wife has paid him a further heifer to relax the avoidance. She may then delegate the task of shaving to a more skilled co-wife or even to the wife of an age mate. He should not then be shaved in any other village, and his hair should be allowed to grow when he is on an extended visit elsewhere. Increasingly among age mates, a man who continues to let his hair grow or to be shaved elsewhere is felt to be a wastrel. It implies either that he has no wife, or that his wife has no cattle to relax this avoidance, or simply that he neglects his domestic responsibilities through his aimless wanderings. He is behaving like a moran. As he settles down to elderhood, it is a matter of decorum for the husband that he should be close shaved. For the sake of her own reputation, his senior wife has little option other than to give him this heifer. Moikan had a good reputation as an elder, and then unaccountably his whole lifestyle changed. He started to have affairs with unattached women, selling off his cattle to give them money, and he neglected the increasing hunger of his wife and children as the herd dwindled. He ignored the advice of his age mates. His closest kin in the area were members of his clan, Makesen, who were only sparsely represented. At first they were in no position to interfere with the way a distant kinsman treated his own possessions. When eventually his oldest son, a moran, approached these clansmen to complain, their indignation erupted, aware that their reputation was now at stake. They mustered themselves as a punitive force, seized Moikan, tied his feet together and whipped him as he lay on the ground. Then they called for a whetstone to file down his front teeth, as the traditional punishment for men who behave like predators. At this point, onlookers from other clans intervened, arguing that the punishment had already gone far enough: he would never risk another beating.",NA,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,MALE,NA,MALE,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,a6558ad981,fl12-020,fl12

If possible he ‘married for’ each son in order of seniority, but at least he should be able to provide cattle for the senior son. And where he provided the cattle he had great influence in choosing the bride, sometimes betrothing the small daughter of a friend when his son was in his late teens, but more often when the son was in his mid-twenties. In selecting the girl he looked for friendship with her father; diligence, cleanliness, and hospitality in the mother; and the absence of any suspicion of witchcraft. According to a group of mothers: ‘If a man is looking about for a bride, and a girl sitting down to greet him does not pick a piece of banana leaf to rest on, but sits down [on the earth] and gets herself dusty he will not have her; or if he visits a home and water is handed to him in a dirty calabash cup, or the water is dirty, he will not have a girl from that home.’ ‘Yes, a man likes beauty, but if the mother is a slattern and does not wash or draw water, even though the girl is pretty, a man says “I'll leave her.”’ An educated Nyakyusa remarked: ‘Some other peoples look for strength in hoeing when selecting a bride, but we look for strength in mudding [a house], and cooking regularly without getting tired.’ The father of a girl looked for a family with cattle, with a reputation for enjoying the company of neighbours, and again, free from suspicion of witchcraft. He rejected a man who was harsh, or had a reputation as an adulterer or a rolling stone, or for meanness or sorcery, and also one who was lazy in hoeing or did not build a house. The reputation of the lineage was as important as that of the suitor himself and the girl's parents might object on the ground that the lineage was harsh, or was reputed to have some hereditary disease like ubusya, characteristic of the Ndali, or the blindness found among the Lugulu. In arranging a match a father was expected to consult the girl's mother, as well as his own father (if alive) and elder brother, and their views [Page 107] carried weight. The girl's brothers who had a claim to receive cattle might also express opinions. Marriage with a chief was an honour but a doubtful blessing because, if his wife committed some wrong, he was likely to take back his cows as fine, and in a large harem a wife might be neglected.

During the following years Fafiti became generally accepted by the Shilluk and his reputation appears to have been high. In the early 1930s a drought in Shilluk country led to a famine and Fafiti's prestige sank. In 1932, consequently, another rebellious attempt (reconstructed by Arens [1979] from government files) was started by nyireth Nawelo, a son of reth Kur. Fafiti, disturbed by some Shilluk men seen near his personal village at night, informed the then district commissioner Titherington about his worries. We learn that the government official assured the reth of “his right of self-defense, including as an extreme precaution employing his armed guards in an emergency” (Arens 1979: 169). However, upon having been informed about Fafiti's worries, the governor of the Upper Nile province, C. A. Willis, answered that [Page 120] “the reth could not shoot all and sundry he thought to be his rivals” (169). Plans were made by the administration to deal with the situation in the event of the reth's assassination. In a secret memorandum the governor held that the succession was to be decided “in accordance with Shilluk tribal custom” (169), while at the same time the Shilluk's choice of the successor would be subject to the government's approval. In the case of troubles with the Shilluk, the governor considered the use of military forces; these, he hoped, would include an aircraft “which might render the dispatch of troops unnecessary, as it is thought the effect of a single well placed bomb would possibly be decisive” (170). When Nawelo gathered his followers near Fashoda, he was called in by a government official in Kodok to explain the gathering. At his arrival in Kodok, Nawelo was arrested and the rebellion thus brought to an end. Nawelo Kur had to share the fate of his father: he was sent into exile to the northern Sudan, where he died several years later. The village of Fadwell, a main source of support for Nawelo, was destroyed, the villagers being dispersed. In order to strengthen Fafiti's shaken reputation, the British presented him with a sash, a saddle, a beret, and a deck-chair. Fafiti, who was supposed to travel around to carry out his administrative functions, pointed out to the district commissioner that he did not have a donkey. Thereafter he was presented with a donkey, which was, however, rejected by the king on the grounds of not being good enough. A more magnificent beast was purchased in Khartoum, though it did not arrive in Fashoda until four years later (171 f.).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,15e3c519fc,fj23-030,fj23

Bands of armed nomads, operating in the thick bush or barren plains that lay between the major towns and well sites en route, typically demanded a portion of the goods in transit. Having once exacted their price in tobacco, beads, or cloth, however, the marauders might themselves vouchsafe the security of the caravan over the next leg of its journey. Total depredation of the convoy was rare: it would only encourage the caravaneer to select an alternate route for the return journey, perhaps to the benefit of a rival clan. Bandits were, moreover, subject to clan law, and an influential abbaan could usually mobilize support for their punishment. Similarly, the abbaan had to resist the temptation to betray his client; his reputation as “protector” of trade could easily be sullied by a deceived merchant, who might compose a bitter poem to spread along the caravan routes.

It may perhaps be useful to compare Tuareg interest in camels with Nuer interest in cattle so brilliantly described by Evans-Pritchard. Nuer caress their animals, and there is a tendency for human beings and cattle to form, so to speak, a single community (Evans-Pritchard 1940, p. 16–50). This is not exactly true of Tuareg and camels. The Tuareg do not pat their camels which will not respond to caressing, and they do not live in very close contact with their animals, most of which frequently graze far away from the camp under the supervision of one or two herdsmen. But the Tuareg nevertheless have much the same feeling towards camels as Nuer have towards their cattle. They are very fond of their animals. They may abstain from camel's flesh because they are fond of camels and would feel very sick at heart when eating them. But though the Tuareg are fond of camels as such, they are delighted particularly at the sight of a very fine camel (akemhur; Ahaggar) and may even speak disparagingly of a badly built animal (amugey; Ahaggar). Fine camels add to the prestige of a man, while too many animals of poor build may even harm his reputation. When girls and young women praise camel-riders in their songs they praise those mounted on fine and richly-decorated animals. When camels are mentioned in poetry this may also be done as praise to their owners, as in a poem composed in honour of noble Tuareg of the Ura□en (Kel Ajjer) of whom it is said that “their pack-camels have feet as large as a drum, and the loads they carry are like the crests of mountains” (Hanoteau 1896, p. 218). Such reference to pack-camels, however, seems to be rare in Tuareg poetry, while riding camels are frequently mentioned in connection with warfare and love. Riding camels have much the same esteemed position as had horses in Medieval Europe. Tuareg interest in camels is particularly focused on riding camels and there is a tendency towards identification [Page 106] of riders and their camels.

Tuareg themselves construe the power of words as effecting changes performatively; for example, good diction is believed to ward off sorcerers and destructive forces. Speech and music are thus equivalent to moral power. Awal, for example, approximately “evil mouth” or back-biting, is believed to be capable of harming a person or property. Livestock may die upon pronouncement of covetous or resentful words; a camera of mine whose shutter stuck, a problem that I attributed to sand and wind, was explained by friends as being caused by the awal of persons hostile to my photography. On the other hand, verbal skill is highly valued because it is often interpreted as a sign of other positive moral and intellectual attributes. Hence the importance of poetry and song in women's social protest. For while it is shameful to reveal one's true sentiments directly, in particular, love and anger, these may be conveyed covertly in songs that contain social critcisms and personal conflicts. These are given solid reinforcement in women's power to eject the husband from the tent, which belongs to the wife even upon divorce. I encountered men sitting under trees at various times, who sheepishly told me their wives had thrown them out. Yet wives still depend on husbands for certain material goods, namely clothing and household implements, and, except in cases of unusual wealth in herds, for food as well. So at the same time, the song verses reminded Tina and her husband of the importance and leverage of matrifocal ties, despite her resentment of her mother's pressures. The gossip following the songs humiliated Tina's husband in pointing out his continuing low status, despite wealth, due to lack of generosity.

The owner is not necessarily a parent. A chief will commonly provide for the chisungu of a young wife betrothed to him before puberty, or for his maternal nieces or sisters. Men of rank will also provide for ceremonies carried out for their sisters, [Page 57] daughters or grand-daughters as well as for their own daughters. In fact, it increases the reputation of a man of substance to be able to hold such a ceremony. He is said to ‘dance the chisungu’ of so-and-so ( ukumucindila icisungu ). The mistress of the ceremonies (nacimbusa). The nacimbusa organizes the rites, leads the dances and songs, and arranges for the making of the pottery and other emblems required. She is considered to perform a very important service. It is work that demands a detailed knowledge of ritual, industry in carrying through long and even arduous tasks, organizing ability, tact and personality. A successful nacimbusa probably has unusual intellectual ability as well as leadership and the power to attract women from surrounding villages to attend a ceremony and to keep a body of helpers alert and interested for some weeks. The nacimbusa is usually an elderly woman who has proved herself to be a successful midwife. The same terms are used for both roles. She is commonly, though not by means always, a member of the royal clan, and there is a tendency for the office to be hereditary. A nacimbusa will teach the secrets of the chisungu to her brother’s daughter, to whom she owes special obligations, and from whom she can demand service, and she may also teach them to her own daughter. But mere heredity is not enough. A young woman must build up a reputation sufficient to win the confidence of parents so that they will call her in to ‘dance their daughters’ for them. To do this she must show assiduity in attending local ceremonies and attach herself as a special helper to the nacimbusa . She must show capacity and personality, and make a name for herself as a successful midwife.

The possible heirs of a chief, his brothers, maternal nephews or grandsons, try to win favour with the ruling chief and to prove that they know how to exert authority and govern a village ( ukuteko mushi ), and hence they tend to congregate at the Chief’s Court to carry out responsible tasks for him, and in some cases are given headmanships on trial. Once a young mwina[unknown]andu has attained to a sub-chieftainship he hopes to rise to superior positions. These are chiefly given according to seniority, but, where a man has proved himself unworthy, a different choice would be made. Any holder of the title of chief has, further, to keep men living in his village, and to attract visitors to it. The greatness of the dead Citimukulus is always described by accounts of the immense size of their villages, the number of their courtiers, and the great crowd of visitors and eminent people who sat at their feet all day long. Even to-day capitals are much larger than commoners’ villages, and the status of chiefs is still reckoned very largely by the number of huts built round them. A man whose subjects tend to leave his [Page 214] territory, as well as his village, has a bad reputation, and this often happens at the present day, although formerly a commoner had little power to leave his chief’s country. This desire to attain authority, whether over slaves, kinsmen, villagers, courtiers, or the inhabitants of a district is, therefore, the dominant factor we have to consider. The accumulation of food is entirely secondary to it, and only exists in so far as it permits the necessary concentration of service, as for instance, in the chief’s capital. Meat and beer are needed, as we saw, to feed labourers, relatives, and courtiers, and are essential to the working of the tribal machine. To give with a flourish was the glory of chieftainship, as Livingstone found when the Citimukulu of his day (Citapankwa) sent after him the ivory tusk he had sat on because he had touched it. Actual possession of great quantities of foodstuffs does not seem to have been a particularly cherished ambition of the Bemba. They valued a reputation for giving, not for having, and the distribution of food brought by villagers as tribute or levied as toll on the conquered peoples was a measure of wealth. Old men boast to-day about the amount the former chiefs used to take from the Bisa or surrounding peoples, and they respected a man who was able to exact the biggest levy of such tribute.

The creditor effectively opened the case simply by bewailing her misfortune in a loud voice in the yam wholesale yard. She complained about her inability to collect a debt, naming the debtor repeatedly. Friends of the debtor quickly sent word to her in her stall and she came immediately. She did not deny the facts, but argued urgently and quietly that the two of them should discuss the matter privately. The debtor was the one who eventually brought the dispute before their commodity group leader, as defamation of character, seeking to avoid worse publicity. Settling the case was a mere formality, since the debtor was not refusing to pay. She asked for a delay on economic grounds, but affirmed her intention of paying and criticized the creditor for making such a public fuss about it.

Experienced traders demonstrate their character and skill by settling small disputes informally among their neighbors and associates.

Quick and permanent dispute settlement requires a reputation for fairness as well as the mental ability to find a fair solution. Traders also mention speaking ability as an advantage in a leader. Effective speakers more easily convince disputants of their own interest in abiding by a decision.

For men to openly promote their own interests would shame the household and court fission. A labor migrant who turns over only a small portion of his earnings to the household head but purchases animals and consumer goods for himself while household needs go unmet, would diminish the reputation of the household. Personal accumulation is condoned only when the household as a whole prospers. Women, being excluded from the patrimony, must accumulate their own wealth. A woman who owns nothing is considered lazy and a woman who depends completely on her husband is likened to a slave woman. Prior to marriage, young girls now go on migration to aid their mothers in the preparation of the wedding goods which will form the basis of their personal wealth. After marriage, the possibilities for accumulating personal wealth rest primarily on gender-linked activities such as collecting shea nuts, spinning cotton and, more recently, cultivating onions. Once a woman has discharged her provisioning responsibilities (e.g., providing oil extracted from shea nuts for cooking), she may use any surplus as she sees fit. Barren women in particular are concerned with the accumulation of a small store of wealth that can provide some autonomy in old age.

He was promised a very large fee on condition that he produced a larger drum than any possessed by other towns in the district.

Talent is recognised and many artistes become very popular. From a musical point of view one is inclined to think that the native singing is more fascinating than the instrumental music. It is doubtful whether there are any proper songs, but there are a great number of established refrains and recitatives. The leader of a chorus is accorded much the same honour amongst the Ibos as that granted to the minstrel in ancient days in England. He must possess not only the musical gift but the poetical instinct also. He creates his theme as the song proceeds, and great ingenuity is displayed in fitting words to time and tune on the spur of the moment. Any unusual incident is seized upon and utilized as material by the leader, and when this fails he has recourse to the retelling, in song, the exploits of old.

The diviner's diagnosis was an unusual one. Heaven (Nayin) was revealed to have decided to end his life. In other words, unlike a normal person, he had simply died of natural causes. I was puzzled by this, for he had lived what had seemed to me an ordinary sort of life, until a friend explained it to me privately. He had been a slave (da'aber) bought in his very early youth, at least fifty years earlier, by the then Chief. He had lived in the family, ostensibly as a full member of it, but in fact attached to it only by fictitious kinship. Strictly speaking, therefore, he had no ancestors in the community and had therefore never succeeded in acquiring the fundamental credentials of personhood, that is to say, legitimate parentage in a lineage. Had he left a son, especially if the mother was a legitimate member of a Tallensi lineage, this might have been the starting point for an attached lineage (Fortes 1945, Chapter V). But dying thus, without ancestry or progeny, he had proved to be, retrospectively, not a genuine person but a kind of kolkpaar(ə)g, who had, as the Tallensi saying goes, ‘returned to the hills’ (du zoor) at his death. Here we see that a human individual can have achieved all the external qualifications of personhood. He might have shown admirable qualities of character such as wisdom, courage, truthfulness and industry. He might well, therefore, have had the reputation of being a ‘fine person’ (nit pam). But he cannot be authentically a person without the basic jural credentials that are conferred only by right of birth as a member of a lineage and clan. There are, to be sure, indirect ways of getting this status through maternal connections, but they are all linked up with the basic patrilineal principle. There is no way to circumvent the limiting condition of kinship credentials for the individual to be a complete person. This is the implication of the phrase ti nit (our person), meaning a member of our family or lineage or clan, which one often hears. As I have mentioned, a woman, though exogamously and virilocally married, never loses her membership of her natal lineage. She has what amounts to a dual social personality as wife on the one hand and daughter on the other. This [Page 275] is nicely dramatized at the time of her death. A woman, in effect, receives two funerals, one in her husband's community where she is buried and, later on, a short symbolic one at her father's house. This is why a woman passes on to her descendants the matrilateral connections with her natal lineage that are the basis of the moral claims and sentiments of amity that bind mother's brother and sister's son in a classical patrilineal avunculate.",NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,214c862908,fe11-011,fe11

[MC: see category 791, pp. 199-204] It will have been noted that Akiga here approaches it in the rational way, when he says that whenever a man died a ‘violent’ death, whatever the cause, it was attributed to, and in fact claimed by, the man who required a certain number of victims for his initiation. It must also be understood, throughout the above section and in similar contexts, that ‘killing’ always means killing by magical means, and being ‘strong’ always implies being ‘strong in tsav ’ (*tsav = magic) and thus able to bring about the death of other members of the group for the purpose required. Speaking rationally, all that was necessary was for the elder to acquire sufficient reputation to be able to assume responsibility for these deaths as they occurred, but the Tiv certainly believed that he was the cause of them, and the alleged slaughter of human victims for the Poor and other cults was one of the immediate causes of the trouble which led to the witchcraft investigation of 1929.” This was the crux of the matter. The Tiv elders did not really want a chief in the sense which the term implied amongst the Jukun or other neighbouring states. They had no intention that he should usurp their authority, but simply that he should be the instrument by which this authority would be enhanced. Such a system of indirect rule, leaving power in their hands without responsibility, had obvious advantages for the elders, and they took pains to ensure that their protégé should not lose sight of his true position as a comparatively junior member of the group, who held office only by their grace, and whose behaviour was strictly subject to their control. It was only in after years, when the young drum-chiefs had outlived their electors, and themselves attained the status of elders, that they were able to wield any real power. Then the influence which they would normally have had in view of their age was much increased by the title, insignia, and esoteric rites, which attached to the office of tor , 367 and being men chosen in the first place for the strength of their tsav , or, as we should say, personality, they contrived not only to rule their own groups with some show of despotism, but to extend their authority even over the neighbouring clans. There were several outstanding men of this kind living at about the time when the Europeans came into the country, and their names are still apoken with bated breath. Such men were Cia of Mbagen, Kibo of Mbakor, Aba of Shitire, Akaa and (later) Abul Aban[unknown]ga of Ukan. But all these inspired respect or fear in their clansmen by the sheer force of their own will-power, or reputation for tsav , which means much the same thing. Authority rested in the individual, not in the title.” The inference that killing meant power was a perverted corolary of a salutary principle. If only the strong could kill, then, conversely, it was necessary to kill in order to become strong. Thus it came to be believed that a certain number of deaths, brought about by witchcraft, were a necessary condition of 372 election to any important office. Even after the office had been attained, the holder, in order to maintain his influence and reputation for tsav , had from time to time to provide victims from among his near relatives, who were supposed to be ceremonially eaten by himself and his confrères. The effect of the new cult is aptly summed up by Mr. Dewar: ‘To the Jukuns this spurious title ( tor-agbande ), with its sensational trappings, was simply a device for raising much-needed funds, but to the Tiv it was the central feature of a cult of incalculable potency. Moreover, by legitimizing, as it were, the use of destructive magic as an aid to constitutional authority, it introduced a foreign principle into Tiv politics.”",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,91d86b1844,ff57-001,ff57

Perhaps, given his age, it simply represents a more traditional Tiv pattern. He is described by his kinsmen as a “humble, calm, and patient man,” almost always at peace with his wives and his “laborers.” Like most singers, he drinks more than the average, just “to keep his chest open.” Since he was an orphan and is childless in old age, it would appear that composing has been a way of keeping his name and reputation alive in his community. Yet there must be some excuse, a theme, a raison d’être, a cause for taking up the knife and incising songs upon the public mind, and it is here that Tiv composers exercise their individuality. Kaa Mondo takes every possible advantage of his “suffering,” while Akumba Anchan seems to have been a self-made success who became a composer almost by accident. The demand for Nyinya song makers exceeded the supply, and Akumba saw a chance to supplement his income. Akumba is a composer of convenience; Kaa pleads for his necessities. Ada Adi was driven to compose by sorcery anxieties and, when sane, transforms his fears into songs that celebrate marriage. Aneke Tire, the gambler, capitalizes upon his bad eye and disfigurement, mocking himself for money, and heaping abuse on others when it is to his advantage. Hura Iyongo had his career interrupted by leprosy but went on to become the leader of a “singing age-grade.” Adi Bente, once an orphan and childless in maturity, leads his immediate kinsmen on “expeditions” in search of food, money, and women.

"T., Irvine Judith. 1974. Caste and Communication in a Wolof Village. Ann Arbor, Michigan: University Microfilms. https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/document?id=ms30-043","A fourth way of attracting dependents is by giving large feasts at family life-crisis ceremonies or for religious events. The competitive element lies in the size of the feast, since most of these occasions must be celebrated in some such way. While there can be considerable difference in expenditure for the actual food offered to the guest (how many meals are served; how many and what kind of animals are slaughtered; provision of extra luxuries such as soft drinks, coffee, or tea), the greatest expense probably lies in the gifts that the sponsor of the feast must also provide, especially to the nyenyo. One man confided that at a naming-day ceremony he had given for his recently-born child he had been obliged to give a griot 15,000 francs CFA ($55); he hoped that God would come to his aid because he had so badly overextended himself. Besides being the main occasion for giving gifts to one’s dependents or potential dependents, such a feast is also the occasion for shaming one’s peers, putting people in one’s debt (gifts to non-dependents), and creating a reputation. This last is especially enhanced by the griots, not only because of their actual performances praising the sponsor of the feast, but also because it is so well known how expensive griots are. Any man who enjoys the praise of many griots must, ipso facto, be inordinately wealthy. The competitive element of feast-giving, the “ guerre des biens” (Ly, 1967:56), is somewhat covert: comparison of feasts and reputations is made only in private. But competition is recognized--and widely disliked. A very frequent topic of conversation during the year of my stay in Kïr Matar was the current inflationary trend in bride-prices and the general cost of weddings occasioned by the recent wedding of a wealthy store-keeper, who had paid an unusually high bride-price and given an enormous feast. Now everyone else was going to have to give more expensive feasts, or they would be ashamed and their wives would be angry. The store-keeper was censured for putting his own reputation (which, most people noted, was hardly in danger) above the general welfare of the community. Women and griots were also blamed for making a precedent of the store-keeper’s wedding; men feared that no woman would now accept a lower bride-price than the store-keeper’s new wife had received. After some months a public meeting was held and a formal agreement, signed by all village notables, reduced bride-prices and other wedding expenses to certain fixed sums. Unfortunately, however, the chef d’arrondissement was obliged to declare the document invalid because the lower figure was still above the national legal limit. And though the chief of Kïr Matar had made a great effort to try to organize this agreement he admitted later that it would have been difficult to enforce. The lowest-ranking persons, on the other hand, have their own consolations. The nyenyo do not have to live up to the restraints of kerse, yet they do not necessarily have to work in the fields, either. Because the nyenyo, especially the griots, are always on the receiving end of the redistribution of wealth, a large amount of cash and material goods actually ends up in their hands (see ch.8); and not being obliged to be ascetic or to give it away to many clients of their own, they may enjoy a standard of living higher than that of most nobles. Most important for the griot, perhaps, is the indirect political power he exerts over nobles of all ranks. In a situation where political following depends so much on personal reputation, a group that has control over reputation has power indeed. The griot’s praise is the most convincing advertisement of wealth and high connections, and a noble will pay a great deal for this. But the griot’s real power probably comes less from the praise and other services he normally performs for a patron than from the ever-present threat of destroying a noble’s reputation by spreading disparaging gossip or scandal about him. It is this implicit threat that allows the griots to demand [Page 219] such large fees and keeps the nobles in fear of them. This a power, incidentally, that belongs far more to the griots than to other nyenyo, whose non-verbal specializations put them in a less advantageous position (see ch. 8). The success of a particular hahaar poem rests on two things. First is the ability to make the insults specific, to mention scandals and difficulties of the bride and her Family that are actually true, and, if possible, to include details of these scandals that people have not heard before. Hahaar poems of this kind,bearing an actual information load, have much greater impact on the audience’s attention and memory than those which include only stereo-typed, conventional insults (e.g., saying that the bride is promiscuous, but not being able to name names or substantiate [Page 332] the claim). This kind of information is more accessible to the griotes because they travel more, and even visit within the village more, than noble women do. The other skill important in hahaar poems is the ability to compose poetry: control of the meters, rhyme, metaphors and puns that go into a hahaar poem and make it most striking and memorable to the listeners. A “good” insult poem, or lines from it, will be repeated around the village for days. Its composer receives extra money for her efforts, and builds her own reputation as a person to be feared and perhaps bribed, lest she include you in her next composition. At any particular hahaar a griote has a wide choice of vulnerable persons because kinship ties are far-reaching and even the most distant relations of the bride or groom may be included. The case of Moussa G. S. illustrates the hahaar’s power to destroy a reputation--or at least to keep a reputation destroyed. Moussa is a wealthy man who was a favorite subject of hahaar poems in this village because, about ten years previously, he had two affairs with married women (one woman was his brother’s wife), affairs which ended in divorces. These scandals are revived at every hahaar where Moussa is even remotely related to the bride or groom. The ridicule in these hahaar is severe; other [Page 334] people say beforehand that they are looking forward to a hahaar because Moussa will be insulted. Just the mention of his name starts them laughing. Though Moussa made a pilgrimage to Mecca--a proof of piety that few Wolof can afford--to try to rebuild his reputation, people say that he might as well not have gone, that ten more trips would still do him no good. And since that time he has been consistently passed over for political offices that might well have passed to him. Although he had obtained an office earlier, before the time of the scandals, since then most of the powers of that office have been withdrawn from it and given to another. While it may not be the hahaar as such that brought about the public outcry [Page 335] against him originally, several persons remarked to me that were it not for the hahaar’s constant reminder, the scandal might have been forgotten and forgiven long ago. The usual occasions for praising are feasts sponsored by the patron, either on the two great Muslim feast days or for an important family event. These feasts, crucial to maintaining the reputation of the patron as a person of family pride, wealth, and generosity, are an important instrument of political competition and the recruiting of [Page 348] political dependents, as has been mentioned before. In such a feast the griots who sing the patron’s praises do as much to advertise the patron’s wealth as all the food and gifts provided for the guests--not so much because the griot says the patron is wealthy and generous, as because everyone knows how expensive it is to hire griots to do this. The griot who has been highly paid may even wave the money about in the air during his performance, so that everyone can see that the patron could afford to give away 5,000 f.

"Brandt, V S R (1971) A Korean village between farm and sea Retrieved from https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=aa01-057","In one case, the largest land holder in the village had died suddenly several years previously without making any specific provision for the division of his land between two sons, one of whom was still unmarried. The elder brother became head of the household and assumed control of the land. Later when his younger brother married and established a separate household, everyone expected that the older man would give him about one-third of the property, a customary division in such cases. The elder brother turned out to be greedy, however, and gave less than 10 percent of the patrimony to his brother. He is constantly criticized for this behind his back, and his reputation and influence in the village suffer as a result. His younger brother, who is competent and conscientious, does not have enough to support his family and is forced into economic dependence on his brother's household. Relations between the brothers are bad, and the younger frequently talks about leaving the village, although he is a section chief ( panjang ) and respected by his neighbors. The wealthy brother seems to be oblivious to what people think and devotes his time to acquiring more property. In spite of the loss of prestige he still exerts some influence in the community simply because of his wealth. Generosity and hospitality are important in establishing a reputation for good character. A rich man can exert significant influence through his economic power alone, but if he is stingy [Page 98] or excessively sharp in economic transactions, he will not be respected. Without general respect he can not exert real influence, either as an arbitrator mediating quarrels and conflicts of interest or as a promoter of joint constructive effort on a villagewide basis. These more general, diffuse functions are the ones that a truly successful man in village affairs aspires to. To play such a role requires a reasonably secure economic base--specifically, the possession of enough irrigated rice land to support an extended family plus a large enough surplus for ceremonial obligations, the requirements of hospitality, and a certain amount of assistance (usually to poor relatives). Within the village a broad distinction can be made between authority based on formal, permanent hierarchical factors and the kind of direction that is usually exerted informally in an egalitarian context. Hierarchical concepts of authority ordinarily are associated with lineage structure--specifically, genealogical rank, age, and reputation. Bureaucratic authority, also hierarchical in nature, is only an occasional phenomenon in village affairs. Ideally it depends on moral superiority attained through education. Outside the context of lineage and formal bureaucracy strong leadership has no legitimation, and in fact villagers are opposed to it, both in theory and in practice. Of course, men of higher personal reputation or demonstrated skill have more influence in such situations, but everyone has his say and the process of reaching a consensus is often not only noisy but subtle and time consuming as well. An authoritative tone of command concerning work in progress as a rule is just an assertion of personal status. If it is legitimate, the other person will ordinarily defer. If not, it will be countered by an equally positive and usually contradictory statement. In neither case does the barking of orders seem to have much to do with how the job is eventually accomplished. In the absence of clear leadership responsibility, aggressive confident individuals are constantly asserting themselves and just as constantly canceling each other out. No one in S[unknown] okp'o really controlled both sources of personal status. A man whose prestige rests on lineage rank, age, and a reputation for moral behavior is relatively secure from threats to his position. Still, his influence is waning in a changing world where individual energy and initiative are becoming essential for success. The position of an activist, while more precarious, is being gradually favored by new economic imperatives. Formal leadership within the kinship organization is strongly hierarchical and is based primarily on genealogical rank and age, although personal qualities and reputation also affect actual influence. Outside the lineage, a somewhat anarchic egalitarianism exists in which popularity or charisma, wealth, and individual forcefulness determine leadership. Some people, of course, were more popular or more respected and formed a kind of nucleus that attracted others, but no one was excluded. A man with a bad reputation, who is neither liked nor respected, easily joins groups without apparent discrimination and participates in the general cordiality. On the rare occasions when a decision is made to turn against someone and have nothing to do with him (“Let us all refuse to cooperate”; Ilch'e hy[unknown] opcho haji mara ) it is done jointly, and enforced, by an entire clan or by the village as a whole. An individual who tried to do this on his own would merely be depriving himself of participation in a major form of relaxation and recreation. On another occasion the “big house” of a lineage that contained only two households put on an extravagant ceremony ( sosang ) to observe the first death anniversary of the father. This family had been prosperous many years before, but they were quite poor in 1966. The son and household head was not a particularly hard or able worker and had no other economic competence that might have compensated for his easy-going attitude towards agriculture. He was agreeable to everyone, however, and his reputation in the village was good. In particular he was concerned with upholding family prestige by unstintingly carrying out his ceremonial obligations. When men meet repeatedly at some other house in this section, it frequently is a reflection of some enterprise or project in which the owner is playing a leading role. Patterns of influence seem to be more variable and temporary in accordance with the economic success, energy, and popularity of forceful individuals. Whenever money is being spent, and men gather to work on boats, engines, or other gear, the house of the entrepreneur becomes a focal point of activity where large amounts of food and drink are available without reckoning to everyone connected with the project. Ambitious men in this part of the village can acquire almost instant prestige within the neighborhood by such activity and considerations of lineage, rank, and ethical reputation carry less weight. In many cases youth welcomes the challenge to traditional patterns of authority and behavioral codes, and consequently strain between the generations is increasing. Currently the expanding expectations of youth are focused on the desire to obtain more education and--some years later--on the right to choose one's own spouse. Strict deference to elders is regarded less as a moral principle than as a form of etiquette. Nevertheless etiquette of this sort is still a determining factor in establishing a man's reputation, and young men fear social censure. Older men sometimes accuse the young of failing to behave [Page 191] morally, contrasting the present with their own youth. If pressed to be explicit, they usually emphasize lack of deference as the major shortcoming. On the one hand, it is probably true that prolonged residence--even for two or three generations--will not give the “newcomer” a status exactly equivalent to that of residents whose family tombs go back six generations or more. On the other hand, it is part of the essence of the community ethic in S[unknown] okp'o that, even though unrelated, if people live next door and behave “properly,” they can in a relatively short time build close neighborly relations on the basis of hundreds of little exchanges of objects, services, and general good feeling. A man who is open and direct, willing to assist his neighbors, not stingy, and able to hold his own in the give-and-take of informal conversation or drinking groups will be accepted quickly. He may even have a special vogue initially because of his novel experiences and general entertainment value. If his wife refrains from malicious gossip and any suggestion of provocative behavior towards other men, she too will probably acquire a good reputation--provided, of course, that domestic family conflicts are kept under control. The other household, possessing considerable property, had been in S[unknown] okp'o for more than forty years. Although the family head had no pretensions to yangban descent, members of the household had adapted their style of life and manners to that of the well-to-do Yi families around them and neighborhood relations were excellent. The old man had stuck to farming and was a welcome if slightly sententious member of the local sarang pang group. His reputation for honesty and generosity was good and his opinions were listened to respectfully, even if his influence was not particularly great. He invariably assisted others in cooperative work sessions, and when his only son was in the army, neighbors--unwilling to let the old man try to carry the entire agricultural work load alone--stepped in and helped out at the crucial seasons. The son, although competent and a hard worker, was more interested in fishing than farming and mixed freely with fishermen from every part of the village. He was cheerful and straightforward, a moderate drinker, and was rumored to have remained faithful to his wife even though subjected to considerable temptation.",MALE,NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,NA,NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,dfae049359,aa01-057,aa01

As official positions go in Japan, the job seems to be fairly arduous. It demands a combination of character (which includes family reputation) and what we would call personality, with a broad variety of professional talents. The average villager wants a man of maturity and dignity, possessed of as many of the traditional Japanese virtues as possible. High among these he ranks sincerity (makoto), politeness, and a humane interest in the problems of his fellows. The extent to which a superior “character” offsets in the public mind any number of professional failings or incompetencies is one of the more remarkable aspects of Japanese politics. Beyond this, present-day mayors play a leading role in the guidance of village government, which, while not inordinately complex or technical by modern standards, requires extensive knowledge. In a village like Kamo, the mayor should, for example, have a thorough practical knowledge of the problems of farming and irrigation; he should have a fair amount of training and ability in the field of local public finance, since fiscal problems bulk very large in his work; he should also be as familiar as possible with the labyrinthine technicalities of Japanese public administration at the local level. Such knowledge was not necessary in the older and quieter days when the vice-mayor did most of the work. As a consequence, one not infrequently finds [Page 366] that mayors at the village level now ascend through the subordinate ranks in the village office, and particularly from the positions of vice-mayor and treasurer. As of 1950 about half the village mayors of Okayama Prefecture had previous experience in village offices. This phenomenon may prove temporary, however. During the early days of the Occupation's purge of local officials, many villages capitalized on the experience, availability, professional inconspicuousness, and neutrality of vice-mayors by electing them to replace their purged wartime mayors, as in Kamo, where the purged Namba Shigeo, who had occupied the office since 1938, was replaced by the vice-mayor. As Occupation activity and supervision waned, however, some reversion to former practices became apparent. In the absence of reliable national statistics, it is difficult to say how pronounced this is, but the mayor again may often be chosen for reasons not primarily related to professional administrative experience and competence. When this happens, the vice-mayor is usually an experienced bureaucrat who assumes actual control of the staff and day-to-day operations of the village office, much as in the prewar pattern.",NA,MALE,MALE,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,d8c58dfdd3,ab43-001,ab43

Not that there are no wealthy individuals among them, for example, Todo in Tschiloi, who was one of the few Olcha who even owned a lynx-fur coat. But wealth does come into consideration to the extent that it does among the Gilyak, and those blessed with it do not enjoy nearly as much esteem, moral influence, and popularity as among the latter.

Their good opinion of him will be based on one or more factors. First comes wealth, particularly if it is channeled into approved forms of patronage. Villagers uniformly cite the importance of the monetary factor in establishing a prominent reputation. Yet not every respected individual is affluent. Some gain recognition for their outstanding personal qualities. While these qualities are said to be an inherent part of a person's nature (prakriti), it is significant that they reveal themselves in conduct directed toward other people. Good conduct itself merits respect. Sometimes estimable behavior is ascribed to a man's inherent nature (prakriti), but at other times the credit goes to his own efforts. In the latter case, villagers claim that respect is self-earned (apni banai). For example, a person gains respect by showing respect to others. The conventional tokens and gestures that symbolize respect are known collectively as satkar, and exhibiting satkar towards others constitutes an important means of acquiring public regard for oneself. Finally, there are certain purely ascriptive bases for ijjat. These include caste, kinship, age and sex. Superordination a long any one of these ascriptive status dimensions entitles an individual to respect. Specifically, it entitles him to receive those signs of deference that represent satkar. In sum ijjat is attributed to individuals on the basis of diverse criteria. Among the relevant criteria are wealth, personal qualities, good conduct, deferential behavior (satkar) and ascriptive status. In the following pages, each of these factors will be examined in order to clarify its distinctive contribution to the local economy of respect. EARNING RESPECT It is convenient to begin with the factor of wealth. The Garvpur villagers look up to the man who has achieved material success. His ability to increase his income or property holdings wins their commendation. Yet, it is the [Page 45] use to which a man puts his fortune that determines how favorably he is regarded by his fellow villagers. The miser who refuses to help others finds no approval for his stinginess. On the other hand, people praise the man who lends assistance to the needy or devotes his funds to the betterment of the community. Patronage meets with public approbation and counts for more than riches per se.

Such texts portray the unmarried srey krup leak as a shy, ignorant, vulnerable, industrious young woman, who is devoted to her parents, follows their advice and helps her mother at work. Although the ideals presented in these texts are based on norms and values written by an elite of times past, they are not completely irrelevant for women in presentday Cambodia. With only two years of schooling, Srey, for instance, had never heard about the Chbab Srey, yet she held a very similar view on what a ""good girl"" was supposed to be, namely: 'a girl who behaves properly, respects old people, helps her parents, does not play around with boys or seek fun all the time. If she goes to the pagoda, she does not forget to pay respect to the Buddha. That is a good girl. But a bad girl behaves improperly, goes out at night and flirts with boys. That is not good to see.' Srey's comments about a young woman's behavior towards men serve as a reminder of the importance placed on a young woman's reputation when on her own and how closely it is connected to her family's reputation. Just as the srey krup leak can lead her family- and husband- to success, the opposite means that a woman 'at leak' who is not behaving properly, especially in relation to men, can destroy the reputation and wealth of her family.

She should ideally stay at home and preferably not leave the house, let alone the village, without the company of a trusted relative.""

A villager's character and personality may be a significant [Page 197] component of his status and can affect the manner in which he is viewed by his fellows. Certain traits of personality, such as forcefulness or a reputation for wit and good humor may set one apart. But more important is the assessment of an individual's personal character that figures in the various situations such as the selection of a marriage partner, election of local officials, the formation of fictive kin relationships, the acceptance of newcomers into the community, etc. The phrases that are most often heard in evaluation of character are: cEt l?óó (“good character”) and cEt akrowak (“bad character”). 1 
1The term cEt refers to what might be called a center of feeling, comparable to our usage of the terms “soul” or “heart” in phrases such as “he has an evil soul” or “she has a good heart.”
The major characteristics of “good character” are generosity and selfless concern for others; warmth and good natured temperament; abhorrence of fighting, drinking, fornication, and other sins; devotion to family; industriousness; religious devotion; and honesty. 2 
2Cf. the qualities used by Thai villagers in rating one another's prestige as listed in Sharp et al 1953:108–109.
The reverse of such qualities: selfishness, bad temper, querrelsomeness, drunkenness or even worse sins such as thievery, the breaking of Buddhist norms of conduct, disregard of familial obligations, dishonesty, etc., constitute bad character. 3
3A distinction should be made between those persons who have only some of the milder characteristics of “bad character” (such as laziness or addiction to drink) and who are held in low esteem but not utter disrepute, and those who break the strongest norms of conduct (e.g. murderers) and incur utter ignominy. For example, the only real ne'er-do-well in West Svay would periodically exasperate his brother and friends for his drinking, gambling, and general improvidence. But otherwise, he was tolerated and even loved. At the other extreme, one ex-villager was “thrown out” of the community for having committed theft and even murder as an Issarak rebel.                    A man may find a potential fiancée in various ways: she may be someone in his own or a nearby village whom he has known (well or slightly) for years; or someone whom he has only seen or met fleetingly at a temple festival or on a visit to another community; or someone who has been recommended by kinsmen or friends as a good spouse. The physical [Page 469] attractiveness of an individual, especially a girl, is an important attribute when young people discuss marriage partners, and it is obviously a powerful magnet in attracting attention and consideration as a possible mate. 1 
1Some of the qualities of beauty or handsomeness are: medium height and build, olive skin that is neither too white or dark, medium sized eyes that are neither too owlish or small, and regularity of features. Cf. Steinberg 1959:38 who gives different standards of attractiveness.
(E.g., Son, who is regarded as one of the prettiest girls in West Svay, has already received four or five proposals by the age of 18; while Toh, a homely young woman, has just received her first offer at the age of 25, and that one probably because she stands to receive a good inheritance.) But in the final decision, other qualities may assume greater significance. First, one of the most important attributes stressed by villagers is “good character”: a young woman should be modest, have an untarnished reputation, and not be lazy or flighty; a young man should not drink, be industrious and capable of supporting a family adequately, and be generally well-mannered and respectful in demeanor. A second consideration, although it is not explicitly stated, may be the economic status of a possible marriage partner. For example, someone in a poor family with little land may be encouraged to marry an individual who will inherit enough property to [Page 470] support a family; and a number of parents would prefer their daughters to marry men who have non-agricultural occupations or professions (teachers, government clerks, etc.) rather than rice cultivators. Third, there may be other factors to consider; e.g., a man or woman will think twice about marrying a widow or widower (or divorcé[e]) with children unless he or she has no other prospects; and a man normally seeks someone of his own age or younger, although in some marriages the woman is several years older than the husband. Fourth, one final matter is of critical importance; after everything is taken into consideration and a man and woman have expressed interest in one another as potential spouses, the horoscopes of both persons must be examined by an achaa to make certain that they will be compatible. Each individual is born in the year of a particular animal and, according to astrological calculations, unions between persons born in certain years are favorable for marriage, while combinations of other years would be either risky or disastrous (for charts of favorable and unfavorable combinations, see especially Porée-Maspero 1962).",NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,ca91b4a71f,am04-192,am04

While waiting for a ceremony to begin, I asked a small group of men assembled in the Sakathiam temple if we have any way of knowing when we have much merit. One man replied confidently, “Yes, we must know.” They readily agreed that a big house, a good deal of money, eyeglasses, good clothes, or good health were all obvious indications of much merit. Such signs make abundantly clear the condition of one's merit. Equally clear, these signs are themselves the natural results of good conduct at some earlier time. An increase in a person's fortunes would be happily accepted as reward for past merit, though he might modestly characterize it as a matter of good luck.                     Second, a person's position in society is one which villagers [Page 233] tend to see as the result of past conduct—mainly, but not entirely, in previous lives. As Lucien M. Hanks has presented it, from the king at the pinnacle down to the lowest hunter wandering alone in the forest, Thai society is comprised of people occupying positions of influence and power over others commensurate with their merit (1962:1250).     Some of the more pious people in Sakathiam point to another cause and consequence of merit which is deeply personal and thoroughly interpersonal. They said that in the course of making merit one acquires a greater interest in doing so. One becomes [unavailable]haibun: inclined to make merit and to be associated with other like-minded people, who, in turn, reinforce his inclination toward the meritorious. By associating with such people one has more opportunities to participate in merit-making. One acquires a reputation for this manner of living, and one comes to see himself as a person for whom this value is important. Two especially capable village informants stated this personal-social field very succinctly when they said, “If one is good, other good people will come to him.”  Another aspect of merit-making with important consequences for the assessment of one's identity is the accumulation of prestige. Although villagers commonly define their current social status as the product of previous accumulated merit, they also seek to enhance their current prestige. One elderly lady said, “The results of merit are in our own mind [ [unavailable]hai].” But this inner feeling of well-being is greatly reinforced by other people's awareness of one's merit. In the intimate village world, where secrets are few and short-lived, individuals establish reputations for goodness and honesty as they make merit together. Individuals attain prestige somewhat in proportion to their known record of merit-making. They then enjoy a sense of personal worth as well as an enhanced reputation for honesty and reliability, including a better financial credit rating.   By examining the belief that people can simultaneously [Page 234] earn merit and prestige in the presence of others, we may better understand the openly utilitarian view of most village Thai toward their merit, an openness which has seemed naïively self-centered to many outside observers. The karmic tradition contains no injunction against letting the left hand know what good works the right hand is doing. This overt, self-centered interest in accumulating merit is perhaps best understood as a validation of the very existence of merit by its becoming public knowledge. The gathering of one's reputation and karma are aspects of the same interpersonal-spiritual process. Thus one can ill afford to be secretive or coy about good works.",MALE,NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,983f2753b1,ao07-043,ao07

A man appeared bearing the reputation for a dangerous temper, the courage that anger brings, and such skill with a sword that few dared cross him. His daughter told about his life before he came to the new hamlet.    Chyn, free of bondage as a debt slave, then moved with his household to the new hamlet on Kred canal at the invitation of a cousin. From his kinsmen he rented lands. If his reputation did not precede him, he soon acquired a similar one. People said that he was not a friendly neighbor. The officially appointed headman of the area lost three fingers in a sword fight with him (LMH 2/8/54). His daughter told of an incident that occurred a few years later: “My sister Chim married Thaen as his second wife, and all lived together in the same house nearby in our hamlet. When she married, my father gave her a buffalo. Later Chim had two children, but Thaen did not care for them. When my father saw that Chim got nothing from her husband, he took the buffalo back and his daughter, too. So her children grew up at my father's house” (LMH 8/10/57). Such interference was unheard of. A father does not snatch his married daughter home, especially if she has already lived a number of years in another household.          Chyn's talismans protected him against knife and bullet wounds, so that the more outrageous his behavior, the greater his reputation for invulnerability and the more willing his neighbors to let him have his way. Most persons wear a certain number of devices to help them gain supernatural assistance in meeting life's difficulties. Amulets containing written formulae to ward off illness are common. Women often wear amulets to make people kind to them. A person in Chyn's position needed aids to overcome his enemies and protect himself. We do not know Chyn's devices, but the son of another rogue described his father's inventory:
(1) Mak chang ngang (compel fright): spells to make the enemy afraid; (2) khl[unavailable][unavailable]w khl[unavailable]d (miss): to turn enemy's blow before it strikes (see Textor 1960:57); (3) [unavailable]¯p[unavailable][unavailable]: a picture of a woman worn together with a female garment soiled by menstrual blood to confirm power (ibid.:104); (4) leg laj: to prevent being cut (ibid.:63); (5) par[unavailable][unavailable]t: to prevent being cut (ibid.:111); (6) khun phra: if a man uses it, he cannot bathe at the same place as a woman; he must bathe separately. He cannot hang his clothes on the same rack with a woman's. A woman's shirt is an exception. He cannot flirt with the wife of another person. If he wants to sleep with his wife, he must wear new clothes and cannot wear the shirt he uses outdoors. If he does, the power of khun phra disappears (ibid.:523). [LMH 11/23/53].

Though some women make the first move in courtship, they are often regarded by the public as too pushy and aggressive. Modesty has always been considered a virtue for Thai women. Many still believe that a good woman should not go to one she loves but rather wait for him to come to her.   Courtship in Central Thailand has always been dictated by a double standard of sexual morality. Female virginity prior to marriage is highly valued whereas male premarital promiscuity is quietly accepted. In order to protect female virginity, male-female socialization among non-relatives was traditionally restricted as much as possible. Mate selection was, therefore, generally directed by parents and senior relatives."" ""In the 1930s, dating was practiced among some upper-class socialites. However, this way of courtship was viewed by the public as too risky for the woman's reputation and thus considered too controversial. Dating was not generally accepted until the 1970s. Yet among the middle and lower classes at present, dating is considered an appropriate way of courtship only for a couple who are seriously committed to one another. Usually, at the beginning of the relationship, when they want to learn about each other's character, a man and a woman prefer to go out in the company of a group of mutual friends. Female premarital chastity, still highly valued in Thai society, particularly among the middle class, has always been an important deterrant to dating. Thais generally believe that proximity between a man and a woman may lead to premarital sex; thus it should be discouraged. Though the public disapproves of premarital sex, it occurs now and then at all levels of society. Failure to abide by this rule of moral conduct is held to reflect more harshly upon the woman's reputation and her family's name than that of a man.""

Friendly acquaintances and relatives often voluntarily offer to administer to the sick person a remedy that they have become acquainted with through a dream or through one fortuitous circumstance or another."" If such a medical practitioner has acquired a reputation, then he is called sando . Inviting a sando is simpler than getting a priestess. It may happen that the one called does not wish to come because he has something against one of the members of the family to which he is called. The mutual relationship of the villagers is often not of a friendly nature, because people are quick to step on one another’s toes. Custom prescribes that, in case of a refusal, a duit, a piece of foeja, and a chicken (or a piece of cotton) be taken to the unwilling medical-expert. These three things bear the name of aoe tatogo , “the three.” In other circumstances, too, an unwilling person is persuaded by “the three” to perform one service or another, for example, to bear witness in a lawsuit. After the offering of “the three,” one will no longer refuse to accept the invitation, even though it is done with aversion, because otherwise public opinion would be turned against him. The person making the request is then also justified in fining the one who refuses, because he is considered “guilty.” Payment is made for all the medicines furnished, because without payment they would be powerless.

Among them are quite a number whose genitals have not fully developed; women “whose vagina is no more than a hole from which [Page 384] the urine comes”; and men “whose penis is no longer than a finger-joint.” We know of several cases of men who by nature have an aversion to the opposite sex; and girls “who are irritated (cannot stand it) to be touched by a man” ( maringgeanja naisoe ntoeama ). Among the men who from boyhood on have not shown any interest in girls, we have met some capable and courageous persons; one of them was an agricultural priest of great reputation; another was known for his bravery.

He is a man of considerable standing in his own village and in certain cases his reputation may extend much farther afield. Dadup, for example, a tuai burong of the extreme Ulu Ai had in his younger days been a pupil of Busang, from Kesit in the middle Lemanak, and Iban used to come from far to meet Ulak, a well-known tuai burong of the Kumpang valley. The manang , as someone capable of intercourse with the spirit [Page 143] world may be a person of some power in the locality where he operates. Usually his influence is confined to a limited area, though the reputation of certain exceptional manang may extend more widely. But although known for his achievements when effective, the manang is not otherwise a man of consequence or status in the community. Nor did I come across an instance of a manang who was also an augur ( tuai burong ) or headman ( tuai rumah ). On the contrary, the expression ‘to be like a manang’ ( baka manang ) is derogatory since it implies that a man grows insufficient rice for his bilek. Children are scolded for imitating a manang lest they become like one; and children themselves poke fun at a manang in the open when he is disadvantaged in the bright light and they have the security of numbers and the option of an easy escape. In the terms of normal Iban values, the manang is not a success. Success is measured largely in plentiful harvests, and the manang , who has frequently to be absent from his farm, is rarely a successful farmer, although his own farm-work may be supplemented by the labour of others given in lieu of payment for his services. Since a good name among men is also associated with physical prowess and skill in felling, hunting, and on expeditions, the manang is seldom a man of standing. The majority of manang suffer or have suffered from a physical handicap of which blindness or poor sight is by far the commonest, and a characteristic associated with the manang . While the manang may not enjoy the prestige of a respected position in Iban society, he is nevertheless likely to be widely known and feared by many.

Wealth was always reckoned in terms of heirloom property, either old ceramic jars of Chinese origin, or Brunei brassware, the acquisition of which bestowed both material gain and good reputation. Even today, when a young man returns to his longhouse after working in the timber camps of Sabah, bringing a new sewing machine or an outboard motor, he is carrying home much more than a mere utilitarian object. The Brookes created superior headmen ( penghulu ), who they hoped would exert authority over many longhouses throughout whole river segments, but their performance was frequently disappointing to the Government. Iban society was indeed capable of producing powerful leaders who exercised influence over wide areas, but such ability was entirely a function of individual performance and reputation. Achievement in pioneering, oratory, and above all in warfare enabled a man to attain high political stature. To be considered a war leader, an individual had to possess not only a reputation for leadership ability, but for a necessary range of personal religious experience as well. Such a leader--one who had dreamed the necessary dreams--was said to be “able to attack” ( tau serang ), and once a man achieved this label he could count on a following. Nevertheless, some of the most famous Iban rebels and warleaders, including Bantin, were not tau serang , indicating that this religious qualification was not a rigid requirement. The son of a famous leader enjoyed a head start toward achieving fame and influence himself, but, without the necessary personal qualities, no amount of hereditary position, much less Government support, could make him an authority. The Brooke historians, Baring-Gould and Bampfylde, later wrote that Bantin was a “man of no rank”, a meaningless observation in view of the utterly classless nature of upriver Iban society. It is true that Bantin's father was not, like Ngumbang, a leader of great stature, but only a warrior of average reputation. It is also true that Bantin himself never claimed to have experienced the particular kind of dreams which alone enabled a man to take formal command of large forces.

Melintang's reputation as a bard of power was established by the victory over the enemy's house for which he had sung. He was requested to sing for numerous rituals upriver and down. A man could achieve recognition as a raja berani only through a fortuitous combination of pioneering, successful farming, and an outstanding career as a war leader. The pioneer not only contributed to the survival of the Iban by opening up new land, but also obtained distinction for himself and his descendants. Success in rice farming has been described by Iban as the sine qua non for prestige. A man who had earned the respect of his peers and their belief that he had received a spirit helper ( antu nulong ) would announce his intention to go head-hunting. The degree of respect he had created was commensurate with the number of men who would follow him.If his raid was successful, his reputation was enhanced. ‘Nothing succeeds like success’ is an appropriate observation for Iban demands upon themselves.Jugah's reputation as legal scholar was enhanced by his participation in a meeting held in 1952 to revise the Tusun Tunggu (native law) of the Third Division.

So he was almost always taking part in the discussion, in almost every item. Other Penghulus , well, they did take part, but not as often as the Tun.

"Villaverde, J, Worcester, D C, & Case, L E (1909) The Ifugaos of Quiangan and vicinity Philippine Journal of Science, Vol 4, 237–262 , plates Retrieved from https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=oa19-019","I have already said that the Ifugaos have no king, nor ruler. They pay tribute to no one. Each one is the absolute monarch of his house and person, and although this individual liberty is one of the principal causes of their miserable and almost anarchical state, it is certain that it is one of their most dominant passions. But although this is so, nevertheless there is among them a certain class of nobles who exercise in greater or less degree prestige and moral authority over those regarded as plebeians. This class is founded on the power of riches, receiving greater respect if the rich man has acquired a reputation for bravery by killing people and cutting off heads. It makes no difference if he has employed treachery to this end, for dishonesty and meanness, [Page 242] so repugnant to the heart of civilized society, are not recognized among the Ifugaos; on the contrary they are accustomed always to attack from behind, not doing otherwise unless by virtue of necessity. They believe in two places to which they go after death. For those who die a natural and ordinary death they believe the abiding place to be in the earth and toward the north, calling it Kadungayan, the word by which they designate the northern region. They say that the dead live there reunited in a forest of special trees, which, although they appear by day as such, become converted into houses similar to those of living Ifugaos when the obscurity of night arrives. They are positive that they have gardens of sweet potatoes and other vegetables and that the spirits eat the invisible substance of the animals, rice and other things which their living relatives offer them. Thus, they say that the wine which the living drink serves as a drink for the dead, each getting what belongs to him according to his state. They affirm that those who rob or kill without reason receive here their deserts, and if one dies without paying the penalty the same conditions will continue in the towns of the dead as in the living. He will pay there for his fault with some lance thrust which one of the dead will give him. When the story has come to this point, to which only some old and wise man is able to bring it, they do not answer further. If one attempts to go on they only destroy what they have said with monstrous contradictions. They say that some of the spirits from that region come back to visit the place and settlements of the living Ifugaos. One of them, according to the story, came with his wife to visit his relatives who maintained them with the most excellent rice flour. When the relatives got tired of such heavy expense they sent them away, it is not known where, and they finally came to rest on one of the mountains of the Mayoyaos to the east of Cauayan in Isabela. While the man was sitting on a rock in the shade of a tree there fell upon his head the droppings of a bird which was perching there, from which it resulted that while he remained seated there burst forth from his very head a tree that they call basisi, from the [Page 249] bark of which the poor Ifugaos make their skirts. This tree grew very large and still exists over the sitting Ifugao. Two ladders represent them; the one this man, and the other, I believe, his wife. The Ifugaos are wont to have them at the entrance of their granaries as guardians and protectors of the rice. They offer or place before them a little rice flour during the feast which they make at the end of the harvest, while they are filling up on the flesh of hogs and buffaloes and are getting as drunk as possible. Those who die from lance thrusts or who die any other violent or sudden death, as well as women who die in childbirth, they assign to heaven, or the abode of the gods which they worship, and they mean by heaven, or the abode of the gods, the stars and planets, especially the sun. They give the following account of the origin of the sun. The Lord of the Sun, whom they call Mananahagut, gave orders that certain Ifugaos should go and kill another one for some fault or other, the Ifugao in question being left, as a result, dead and headless. Lord Mananahagut, moved, it would appear, by compassion, sent his wife, Bugan, charged to invite him and persuade him with gifts and caresses to ascend into heaven, but the spirit of the Ifugao refused the caresses, and refused to go to heaven, in spite of the beetle nuts, tobacco, and vino which were given him, because the woman was peculiarly dressed and looked very strange. The wife of Mananahagut, noting this, disposed of the greater part of her clothing, remaining half naked, as is the custom with the Ifugaos, caressing further the dead Ifugao, and offering him endless pleasures in heaven. Satisfied with this, the Ifugao accompanied her immediately to heaven being received with the greatest joy by Lord Mananahagut, who gave him splendid feasts and dances. For this reason, and I know not for what other, the Ifugaos believe that people who are killed by lance thrusts go to the abode of the gods, but although in said place they are happy, their happiness consists in filling themselves with the flesh of hogs and carabaos and in drinking, and getting drunk on the vino which they make. Neither for their gods nor for the souls of the dead, nor for those who live in mortal flesh is there any greater happiness than the satisfaction of the carnal appetites. The practices and ceremonies which they employ with the dead vary, according to whether the deceased died a natural or a violent death. For the first they spend all and more than they have, ransacking the neighborhood, gathering hogs, carabaos and vino, which they give to eat and drink to all their relatives, because they believe that the souls or the spirits of the animals which they eat are the food of those who go to Kadungayan. They keep the body four, six, ten and even fifteen days without burial, placed below the house. All depends on the rank of the deceased; the more important he was the longer he is left without burial. But when they bury those who go to heaven, especially the trunks of the corpses the heads of which have been carried away by the enemies who have killed [Page 250] them, they only kill the hog, which is eaten by some of the oldest and most experienced in the rites which they have practiced, because, they say, those who go to heaven get no good from the spirits of the animals which their relatives eat, but, on the other hand, the animals which the assassins kill and eat in the great feasts which they celebrate, when the brave are crowned, serve for the spirits of those whom they have decapitated. They say that the Ifugaos die twice, understanding by one of the times their falling sick. They affirm also that the spirits do not go immediately to their final destinations, but that they remain for a longer or shorter time near by, leaping from rock to rock, and from tree to tree, maintaining themselves on the remnants which they can obtain by entering the houses at night. The object of remaining in this way is to see if they can take with them the spirits of their relatives, in order that husband and wife may live together, and that children may live with their parents. In consequence, they believe also that sickness consists in the departure of the spirit of the sick man from the body, attracted or violently carried away by the spirit of the deceased relative; wherefore, when they become somewhat seriously sick they call the charm-healer that he may make the spirit return and give health to the body. These charm-healers, who are a pack of frauds and deceivers, cure in the following manner: Hardly has the healer entered the house of the sick person when they give him a fowl, which he kills in the name and honor of the old woman and wife of Kadungayan. He observes the state of the gall immediately, and after having looked very intently at the sick man, states his diagnosis in the following terms, or others somewhat similar: “The spirit of this sick person is in such or such a place, having gone to visit the spirit of his grandfather, wife, son, father, etc. In order to bring it about that it may return, there is need of so many hogs and a carabao or two, because in that way the soul will decide to return with great pleasure.” The family then diligently prepares what has been indicated, procuring it by some means if they do not have it at hand. When the animals indicated have been killed, or while they are killing them, the healer calls the spirit with the point of a lance, in order that it may come down by the lance to the sick person. He invites it to come down, saying that there are so many hogs prepared, so many carabaos, and so much vino; sometimes he seizes a gansa and produces upon it a tremendous noise. I do not know why it does not break the head of the sick man. At other times he announces that he sees the spirit in such and such a place; that now it is coming down; that it now has left the spirit of its grandmother, and that now the sick man will get well. More, since the sick man dies or is cured according to the will of God, he often remains as sick as he was before, or becomes sicker; his friends then call the healer again, or summon some other healer with a greater reputation, if there is one, and the same performance is repeated. The healer says: “The soul of this person has gone away again; such and [Page 251] such a spirit detains it in such and such a place. It would seem that it has become accustomed to the other life, or wishes to live with its dead wife; there is need of more hogs and more buffaloes to make it come down.” Finally the sick man dies, if it is the will of God, after those of his household have spent everything they have. This is the way of curing the sick, at whose expense the well eat and drink, the healer carrying away meat enough to last for many days in addition to his pay. As a result, the family often is completely ruined, the usurers getting away from them their estates or fields.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,MALE,NA,NA,MALE,79b570fc2a,oa19-019,oa19
"Brenner, S A (1998) The domestication of desire: women, wealth, and modernity in Java Retrieved from https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=oe05-038","The colonial dismissal of Javanese trade as trivial women's work reinforced the priyayi's deprecation of merchants as well. The priyayi had little respect for sudagar men, both because they had no official rank and because they were overly concerned with the pursuit of money, which was seen in priyayi ideology as especially demeaning for males. It would appear that the priyayi also saw sudagar men as men who could not control their women. Members of the priyayi class looked askance at the involvement of women traders in the market, a place that they associated with things kasar: coarse language and behavior, lust for money, and unrestrained association between the sexes. To permit one's wife to trade in the marketplace was to expose her knowingly to the dangers of uncontrolled desires. As the self-appointed custodians of the alus, the priyayi declared the market a place inappropriate for women of high rank to work. Female traders were also viewed by members of the high nobility as unsuitable partners for marriage; I once heard a local scholar, who was also the granddaughter of a former sunan, state in a public forum that Javanese kings had always refused to marry traders because of their reputation for being “loose.” I will return to this association of unrestrained female sexuality with the marketplace in chapter 4, when I discuss the relationship of women, money, and the control of desire in contemporary Solo. It would be difficult to imagine the husbands of these women to act this so, or even to imagine the women themselves being willing to act this freely if there were men around. However, this, like their willingness to handle money, should not be taken as an indication that women are considered [Page 142] sidered to be kasar, or of low status, in any absolute sense. Rather, in many situations, Javanese women have a broader range of social and linguistic styles available to them than do men (see Keeler 1990). To the extent that their comportment and speech are accorded less weight than men's, women have the freedom to engage with relative impunity in behavior that would be compromising to men's status. Women are not though incapable of behaving in an alus manner—indeed, it is primarily women, not men, who are given the task of educating their male and female children in linguistic and behavioral politesse—but the wider range of social styles deemed acceptable for women gives them the reputation for behaving erratically, and not always in accordance with standards of refined behavior. One of the local scandals that occurred while I was living in Solo concerned a shy young woman, Yanti, who worked as a secretary. Yanti had agreed to marry a man whom her parents, a wealthy merchant couple, had found for her. Only one month before the wedding was to be held, and long after the couple had formally exchanged rings before several hundred guests in an elaborate engagement ceremony, Yanti suddenly ran off with her boss, a divorced man with children, causing her parents great embarrassment and distress. Rumors of black magic immediately began to circulate in the neighborhood—many people assumed that Yanti would not have done something so disrespectful to her parents and damaging to her own reputation unless her employer or someone else had put a spell on her. Her father, while not denying the possibility of black magic, suggested that the man had ultimately won her over by allowing her to handle the large sums of money that came through the office. I took his remark to mean that by entrusting her with that much cash, Yanti's boss appeared to identify her concerns with those of the business, and therefore with his own concerns as head of the office. Yanti's father, I believe, was drawing an implicit parallel with the family, where the husband/father, another figure of authority, entrusts his wife with control of the household's money, thereby linking her interest in the family's prosperity with his own. As an unmarried woman who had never before been given responsibility for [Page 157] managing money, Yanti was thus flattered into imagining herself for the first time in the position of a wife. Yanti's father attributed her elopement with her employer to the fact that he allowed her to handle money, rather than to any other means of seduction. This was consistent with the popular notion that women's interests lie primarily in domesticity, and only secondarily in passion.",NA,NA,NA,FEMALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FEMALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5379d47a78,oe05-038,oe05

Also relevant is his brother Hamzah's access to state and federal officials and resources, and his own orientation toward “getting things done” for close kin, other allies, and the village community as a whole. Ibrahim's successes in this latter capacity and his stature as a big man are further enhanced by the titled positions he holds on the village councils (the UMNO Committee, the Village Development Committee, and the Mosque Committee), which nowadays constitute the principal organs of local government in Bogang and throughout the Peninsula. Finally, there is Ibrahim's close relationship with the village headman, who is married to Ibrahim's lineage sister (his MMZDD) and lives with affines who are Ibrahim's most immediate enates. This in-law bond makes the two leaders natural allies and mutes any potential antagonisms and rivalries between them—for the village headman is also a “big man,” and he derives much of his support from individuals who, in the event of an intraclan dispute, would usually back Ibrahim. The larger issue, though, is not the muted competition between the two leaders but rather their reputation for furthering the material and other interests of the same relatively small group of people, most notably the members of Ibrahim's lineage (Hill) and the men who, like the village headman, have married women of that lineage.

These requests for information typically came from those who “haven't mixed much,” like village girls who had never worked in factories, for they did not usually receive any advice or information about sex or physical intimacy from their mothers, or from anyone else. As a consequence, they really didn't know how to behave when they were approached for the first time by their husbands, and they were understandably scared, he said, adding “we were scared at first too, right?” (kita pun takut mula-mula juga, bukan?). But Zainal didn't usually bring up sexual matters, because he didn't think it was his place to do so. And he worried about his reputation: “What would people think of me if I just started talking to them about sexual matters? They would surely think that is very inappropriate.” “It is important to guard one's reputation; it's not that I don't like you; it's just that people would talk a lot and my standing in the community might suffer if I was overly friendly with you, or interacted too freely with any other male [married or single].” She went on to explain that when her brother-in-law comes home, she doesn't talk with him much and generally eschews interacting with him altogether. Particularly if he has brought male friends to the house, she serves them coffee or tea and then disappears into the kitchen. On many such occasions she instructs one of the children of the house to bring them food and drinks, thereby avoiding all contact with them. Similarly, when she walks through the village on her way to or home from work she usually avoids eye contact with people. More broadly, she seeks to maintain a good deal of distance from everyone in the village. It is important that such distance be maintained, she told me, lest others “lose their respect” for you. She thus implied a positive relationship between social distance and respect, such that the greater the social distance (and formality), the greater the respect. Significantly, she also made an explicit reference to “fear,” and to the necessity, or at least the desirability, of having people fear her, so that they would be reluctant to “bother” (kacau, menggangu) her. This particular strategy has earned Chegu Rokiah the reputation of being sombong (arrogant, haughty, unresponsive to social expectation) and extremely garang (“fierce”). Some younger adult men and women (e.g., her cousins) are indeed afraid of her, though such fear might also reflect their recognition that Chegu Rokiah has a well deserved reputation for having a very sharp tongue and a “bad mouth” (mulut jehat).",NA,FEMALE,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,FEMALE,FEMALE,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FEMALE,NA,4ccefb8e98,an05-194,an05

Such a practice reduces the visibility of the prostitute's occupation and allows other villagers to be more accepting of the individual than they would otherwise be. Residents of two villages in which a prostitute resided displayed a complex regard. One woman, the sole support of three children and an elderly mother, was acknowledged to be a prostitute, but villagers, emphasizing that she was a dutiful daughter and caring mother, also termed her a good person. The other prostitute was also engaged in supporting a family, but her reputation for a short temper and a sharp tongue elicited a more ambiguous response from other villagers. They approved of the manner in which she cared for her children, emphasizing that these were well behaved and skilled in courteous behavior, but they termed the mother a weak and undesirable person. Significantly they discriminated between her sexual behavior and her irascibility in making this judgment. It is apparent that a known prostitute who limits the visibility of her professional activity and who exhibits other behaviors congruent with village values can be reasonably well integrated into village society. Villagers tend to compartmentalize her behavior and to discriminate rather carefully in assessing her social persona. This situation was delicate and a source of potential trouble. Yusof had already had something of an “adventurous” youth. His grandparents, with whom he lived in Wakaf Bharu, had arranged an early marriage for him in hopes that the responsibilities of a family would help to moderate his behavior. He had a reputation as a “brave person” (orang berani), which was not entirely a compliment. In the delicate balance of village life, people who are headstrong and emotional are apt to create problems in maintaining sesuai. A good citizen is one who retains emotional control and whose behavior is always predictable. Yusof was both admired and feared for his penchant for direct confrontation. His declaration that he would confront the debtor in a public setting made the village a party to his actions. One of the major sources of village entertainment and gossip involved a pair of brothers-in-law who lived just down the road from us, and who had been on bad terms for three years. Ali was a well-liked villager, born and raised in Wakaf Bharu, who worked hard and who supplemented his farming income by working as a carpenter. He was known to be honest, dependable, and possessed of a strong temper. Despite the last, he also had a reputation as a “good hearted person” (orang baik hati), a person who acts from genuinely good motives as opposed to someone who behaves well out of a concern with form. In contrast Ismail was a village ne'er-do-well with a reputation for being lazy, unreliable, and spiteful. Peasant societies consist largely of rural populations often little differentiated in terms of wealth or other distinctions. Kelantanese add texture to their social lives by developing reputations for cleverness or skill in a particular area of endeavor. There are a variety of respected skills (kepandaian) that villagers may emphasize, such as Koranic chanting, the weaving of traditional mats (tikar), songbird training, cooking, and of course, the training of fighting cocks and bulls. Thus cockfighting remained an extremely popular activity among males, and a villager could [Page 136] gain a reputation as a clever trainer with only one or two successful birds. The popularity of fowl fighting and its cocksure place in Kelantanese culture are indicated by the specialized vocabulary that has grown up about it. There are terms for the various types of fighting cocks, for their body parts, for their trainers, for aspects of the actual matches, and for the areas in which these fights transpire. If training fighting cocks is a common and popular means of gaining a reputation for a valued skill, training fighting bulls is both less common and more highly regarded. Part of the regard stems from the expenses involved. The owner of a fighting bull will likely have paid a considerable amount for the animal when it was only a calf. Calves sired by fighting bulls with strong reputations could command as much as M$10,000, though that was rare. Add to these costs the expense of feeding the animal, caring for it, and training it, and you have a pastime that only a few are willing to support.",NA,MALE,MALE,FEMALE,MALE,MALE,NEUTRAL,NA,FEMALE,NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FEMALE,MALE,b750958455,an05-196,an05

"Malarney, S K (1997) Culture, virtue, and political transformation in contemporary Viet Nam The Journal of Asian Studies, Vol 56(no 4), 899–920 Retrieved from https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=am11-183","The opposite of the leader who “lived far from the people” was one who was “good with the people” (t□t v□i dân) or “had a good heart with the people” (có lòng t□t v□i dân). The reputation of a leader who was “good with the people” was predicated upon a number of factors. One was the public expression of commonality with others. Contrary to the relentless assertion of superiority offered by someone like Nguy□n Đ□c Nghi□p, this type of leader comported himself as if he were any other resident. This image of the leader as one of the people can be traced back in Vietnamese history. The biography of one of Th□nh Li□t commune's most revered ancestors, the mandarin Bùi Xu'o'ng Tr□ch, who received his doctorate (ti□n sĩ) in 1478, provides a classic illustration: “When he was a young man he worked as a farmer yet he was extremely industrious and fond of study. When he went to work in the rice fields he would take books along with him and at night he would read by the light of a phosphorescent lamp. Even though he did not abandon farming and studied at the same time, he still made rapid progress. He passed the exams on his first attempt. When he was informed that he had received the degree he was out plowing his rice fields. The villagers found this to be quite honorable.” (Phan Huy Chú 1973, 157) The same biographer concluded that “his good heart and great respectability led the people of his age to revere and admire him” (Nguy□n Q. Th□ng and Nguy□n Bá Th□ 1991, 65). For a political leader to be considered “good with the people,” it is critical that he “live with sentiment” and be “virtuous” according to this local sense. Again, Bùi Tr□c provides a useful historical example. Despite the fact that Tr□c was the financial commissioner of Hanoi and later attained the rank of second class mandarin, when he returned to his village he removed his mandarinal regalia and walked around in normal clothes. Furthermore, he was a common figure at local weddings and funerals. Another Giáp Nh□ mandarin, Bùi Duy□t, was also famous for his regular presence at weddings and funerals after he retired from his position as a provincial governor (tu□n ph□). Indeed, the most highly praised political leaders were those who “lived with sentiment” with the people in their community. In doing so, they not only earned a reputation as “having a good heart with the people,” they also mobilized a different conception of virtue. Unlike the strict adherence to party doctrine inherent in the official definition, this virtue was constructed out of the leader's expression of solidarity and equality with the people. Earning this virtue was critical to becoming an esteemed political leader. Political leaders in rural Northern Viet Nam who conduct their lives with probity and discretion, who are effective in bringing benefits to their coresidents, and who are “virtuous” by local standards, are ultimately the most prestigious men in local life. The accumulation of prestige is predicated upon effective leadership combined with honesty, “sentiment,” and commonality. This fact helps provide a final answer to why local residents turned against President L□i, and to why they initially came to the support of Chairman Binh, but later rejected him as well. L□i, from the party's perspective, had many virtues. He was a strong, disciplined leader, unafraid to implement the party line, even if it entailed a degree of local dissatisfaction. During his time as president, he ran his administration very efficiently and was, despite some problems, reasonably successful. For these reasons, the commune's party cell continued to endorse him as their candidate for president. Among the people, however, the former president's reputation was lacking. Many considered him to be rather cold, aloof, and distant, and others wondered if he engaged in unscrupulous practices. Many also thought that he carried himself with a measure of superiority and that his work style tended toward commandism. One of his elderly supporters who lamented his election defeat quite candidly told me, “L□i had spent too much time as an Army officer. He was too used to giving orders. That style won't work around here.” L□i also suffered from being considered someone who lived with little “sentiment.” He only infrequently attended local weddings and funerals. He remained outside the local world of sentimental relations and was not regarded as a valued member of the local community. No one I have spoken to has ever denied that he was a very intelligent and skilled leader, yet his demeanor with the people was seriously lacking. [Page 915] Chairman Binh was a very different type of leader. The official charges of corruption and the local charges of nepotism illustrate that he did not fit the party's vision of a virtuous leader. Nevertheless, during the early years of his tenure as chairman, he did a number of things that earned him a solid reputation among residents. After he became chairman, Th□nh Li□t cooperative became one of the most productive in the region. The high standard of living pleased residents. It also contributed to local pride because Th□nh Li□t was doing better than the majority of cooperatives in neighboring communes. Binh was also willing to subvert government rules in order to help local residents. Government policy dictated that rice harvested in the cooperative be stored and distributed to the cooperative's pig farm, while the farmers were to eat rice provided by the government. The quality of government rice, however, was extremely poor. The grains were usually broken, it tasted bad, and was usually moldy after sitting in government stockpiles. Binh ordered the storage of government rice in the cooperative granaries for feeding to the pigs, while the cooperative's rice was harvested and given directly to local families. Binh also turned a blind eye to the illegal slaughter of livestock for local feasts. Government policy severely restricted the unregulated slaughter of livestock, but Binh, in recognition of their importance in local ceremonies, turned a blind eye so long as the slaughtering did not become excessive. Just as a good leader should, Binh used his position to assist those within his community.",MALE,MALE,MALE,MALE,MALE,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,038886ddcb,am11-183,am11

This generalization may represent positive approval or negative criticism. It implies a distaste for ‘dirty’ subsistence tasks, and relative success in the pursuance of status values based on material consumption and display. Though a minority of Sevetti Skolts actually conform to this image, those that do often regard non-Sevetti people - even immediate kin - as rather rustic backwoodsmen. A precondition for the realization of elite aspirations is access to a regular salary, whilst only through marriage and the formation of a local domestic unit can status claims be manifested as a ‘standard of living’ on the household level. According to these criteria of income and marital status, the native Skolt elite comprises, besides spouses in mixed marriages with immigrant professionals, only three families of the junior generation. All three are major clients of the ‘Trading Centre’, and all have frequent contact with Commune Point as a result either of employment or kinship with Skolt residents. A distinctive characteristic of all elite couples is the full- or part-time employment of the wife, who may even be the principal earner. No politician can hope to establish a base of local support solely through his activities as a protagonist. If he is already securely established in some office of the wider society, grass-roots apathy may be of no consequence; whilst claims to successful focusing validated through the mass media may enhance his reputation in the more comprehensive framework of the Lappish movement. For the less well-founded, however, protagonistic ideals must be compromised by an element of political brokerage which can be seen to bring positive local benefits. Support so gained may provide the politician with a foothold from which to project an image of his role as a protagonist in the service of the Lappish movement.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5721618bbf,ep04-021,ep04
"Paine, R (1994) Herds of the tundra: a portrait of Saami reindeer pastoralism Retrieved from https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=ep04-019","In short, a man's reputation among his fellows does not slavishly follow herd size. Several factors intervene. One (to be explored in Chapter 9) is herd composition, beyond the matter of its size. Another flows from recognizing how, at any given time, herd size is bound up with the maturation of the family, for which the husbander is the senior custodian. One wants to know: Are the children still with the family herd? Or have they left, each taking a number of animals with them? It is also conceded that even the most diligent husbander may suffer severe diminution of a family herd through a variety of natural catastrophes. So it is with good reason that these pastoralists are forever asking themselves: “How long has so-and-so been rich?” and “How long will he stay rich?” In fact, the 1933 Act, for all the empowerment it gave to the authorities, was rarely enacted at all strenuously. The Act spoke of compulsory counts of herds every five years. This did not happen. It spoke of maximum herd sizes per District and per individual, but these were not invoked. Two explanations, quite different from each other but interrelated in practice, suggest themselves. One is that the Administration was hopelessly understaffed and underfinanced with one lappefogden and the nucleus of a staff for the whole of Finnmark. All that could really be achieved was the paperwork (e.g., registration of reindeer ownership marks) and a superficial overview of the seasonal round of pastoralism (e.g., seeing that in the autumn herds were on the autumn pastures, which they often weren't). The other explanation rests upon the symbolism of law, whereby the importance or authority of a law is found less in the actual regulations it imposes than in the comfort it offers that our interests are being safeguarded. In the case before us, the interests are, first of all, those of the nonpastoralists in the area--and an appearance of pastoral order in accordance with the accepted precepts may prove sufficient. At the same time, the pastoralists' own interests are cared for through the inactivation of clauses of control present in the law. As part of this pattern, pastures are collected administratively into Districts, each of which has to elect a foreman (this is still the case: see Chapter 14). In the 1960s this person was less likely to be chosen on account of his (only men were elected) pastoral reputation or prominence among his fellows as for his proficiency in Norwegian and (just as important) “discretion” when dealing with the Administration. The administrative system, then, was externalized, as far as possible, by the pastoralists.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,MALE,MALE,NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,cbb5f9e4dd,ep04-019,ep04

To a greater or lesser extent he himself has become poni, and he may be easily attacked by other ponikana which bring on even more extreme behavioral defects.

Men who exercised influence by virtue of their position in a network extending outside the Cuna system were further divided on a moral basis into those who were “for themselves” and those who were “for the people.” Although the interest in this chapter is in Nele’s role as an innovator, it is important to note also his importance as a culture bearer in the transfer of the Cuna elite tradition, and in the enrichment of the San Blas variant of Cuna culture. Nele has the reputation of having been the most learned man ever to live in San Blas, and this is probably accurate. He returned from Colombia for the last time in 1902.

This minority can partially transcend, to an extent unclear to me (not having studied them close up for any length of time), some of the usual limitations on support and influence; they enjoy more secure tenure and get their way more often than do ordinary chiefs. In the case of Chief Yapilikinye, for instance, whose conservative policies were discussed above, it seems likely, based on the alacrity with which his home island abandoned those policies after his retirement and death, that in the years immediately beforehand they were simply deferring to his wishes, despite majority sentiment in the other direction (see Chapin 1983:467-468, for a similar case). The deference was only partial, however, since concrete houses and other innovations were already creeping in. Even the best-known and most-admired chief can be opposed, overruled, ignored, or thrown out, and much of the reputation of past leaders for efficacy and power obviously derives from posthumous reinterpretation and canonization (see Stier 1979:14; Chapin 1983:142).

He always attended ‘gatherings’ and spoke occasionally, in a quiet, almost shy manner not typical of ‘gathering house’ speakers. But Olowitinappi’s great love and the realm of his greatest success was medicine and curing. He would often go to the mainland jungle twice a day in order to gather medicinal plants.

If Hamid Amin was not so generous, it was argued, he also would be rich and powerful; Sheikh Mohammad was miserly and an old woman. It must be admitted that a mere reputation for generosity may not bring with it any particular tangible reward in the form of economic advantage on practical influence. But the pattern of the society is such that this form of reputation is esteemed above all others, and it is in the light of this set of values that the institution of the Guest House must be considered.",NA,MALE,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,04f445f7f5,ma11-008,ma11
"Masters, W M (1953) Rowanduz: a Kurdish administrative and mercantile center Retrieved from https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=ma11-002","The maintenance of a chaykhana can be a fairly lucrative business, for it plays an important part in the social life of the lower classes. In the absence of any other entertainment, there is almost always a large number of persons in the chaykhanas , merchants, workmen, soldiers and policemen off duty, and loafers. The chaykhana , however, is definitely limited to the lower orders of society. One of the higher ranking officials, for example, the qaimmaqam or the judge, would never be seen in such a place, nor would the army officers. The dividing line is to be found in the teachers, who sometimes visit in pairs or groups, but prefer the town “club” because it has none of the stigma attached to the tea-shop. The landed aristocrats, the chieftains, are not bound by the scruples of official or officer, but tend to avoid the places. The reason is clear and explicit. A man of the higher echelons of society is expected to maintain a diwankhana or guest-room in his home where he can entertain, and to be entertained in the houses of his friends, rather than purchase his refreshment in common with others. Similarly, a man of some standing in the community who spends much of his time in chaykhanas will quickly acquire the reputation of a loafer. Finally, as enlisted men from the army are to be found there on Fridays, there is talk that these places harbor homosexuals ( hatiw baz , “homosexual,” is a formidable term of abuse, an epithet which elicits knives.) In approaching relationships within the mal or “house,” several things must be emphasized in order that a proper perspective may be gained. The first of these is the question of family honor. Personal honor, for example, in cases in which a man might acquire a reputation as a liar, a thief, a weakling, or the like, seems always to be dwarfed by the larger matter of family honor, and, as noticed in the section treating society, this is closely connected with that of the household's women. This is measured in two regards, whether or not the woman has been chaste prior to her marriage and whether or not she remains faithful to her husband after it. One of its several expressions, for women of the upper strata of society, the townswomen of wealthier homes and the wives of the aristoorats and officials, is the wearing of the veil. Such women are required to conceal their faces, if not their persons, from those unrelated or not intimately known to their families. The women of the lower classes are unveiled, but even then are not permitted extended traffic, such as lengthy conversations, with males unknown to their husbands. The decorum demanded of women serves to orient relation-ships within and without the household. Coupled with this [Page 242] is the concept of the inequality of male and female, the second held to be a necessary but weak and volatile component of the scheme of things. The Kurds, as suggested above, claim to hold their women in greater respect than the Arabs, but it is doubtful that this might be carried to the extent known in Europe or America without considerable opposition. In the agricultural villages of the district, the wives and daughters enjoy much greater social equality, inasmuch as they are partners with the men in working in the fields, than in Rowanduz, where the work of men, for example, the trade of the smith or the merchant, is considered impossible or shameful for females. It is thus that, although a man may be discomfitted by being known as cowardly, miserly, or impious, the two worst catastrophes that can overtake the honor of the mal are the murder of one of its members or the indiscretion of its women. In popular theory, the murderer or one of his relatives in the first case must be sought out and slain, and, in the second, the woman in question must be done away with.",MALE,MALE,MALE,NEUTRAL,MALE,MALE,NA,NA,NA,FEMALE,FEMALE,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,9061cc0bd5,ma11-002,ma11
"Lancaster, W (1981) The Rwala Bedouin today In Changing cultures (pp x, 179) Retrieved from https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=md04-003","Reputation is based on how closely a person demonstrates Bedu virtues — honour, bravery, generosity, political acumen and mediatory abilities. In the past when all men were economically equal (this is examined and explicated later) the only way of distinguishing one man from another in terms of worth was by his reputation. Wealth had little meaning as the only wealth was camels, which were acquired, over and above subsistence needs, simply to gain a reputation as a successful raider and then given away to demonstrate the raider's generosity —success in raiding and generosity were the main features in building a reputation. Thus it is possible, indeed logical, for there to be a category of those who excel in acquiring high reputation. Jural equality notwithstanding, some men became more influential than others and so sheikhdom could develop. Unable to express their position by material possessions (for this implied a lack of generosity) sheikhs could only distinguish themselves by maintaining their high [Page 44] reputation, which in practice came down to displaying every Bedu virtue to the fringe of excess (and still does to some extent today). There are limits to these virtues; over-generosity leads to the inability to fulfil normal obligations; over-braveness leads to death and excess political acumen leads to the double-cross. The sublime is but a short step to the ridiculous and sheikhs teeter on the brink. But for the ordinary Bedu the aim is not to excel but to be sufficiently successful to be regarded as a rajul tayyib — a ‘good man’: a man who demonstrates bravery without rashness, generosity without ostentation, political sensibility without double-dealing, honour without false pride, (amour propre rather than orgueil), and an ability to mediate between his fellows. In other words he has to fulfil the normal roles with modest success.          A man's reputation will have been in the making since childhood, and it is, in part, a reflection of his upbringing by his mother (which is regarded as forming character) as well as his use of the assets and options that his immediate family and his three-generation ‘ibn amm’ have made available to him.Did he always look after his younger siblings? Was he generous or mean with sweets? Did he protect those smaller and weaker than himself? Did he try to mediate in squabbles? Did he succeed? Did he shirk work? Or did he only seek out the easier or more glamorous tasks? Has he built up the basis for his own future economic network or did he rely entirely on his father's? Is he too quick to take offence or too complacent? And so on. Males of all ages lead a life exposed to the public gaze and memories are long. A man's public life starts at about the age of two when he begins going through to the men's side of the tent on his own. Thus his early reputation is based on his willingness to fulfil the role of son. A man whose father has a good reputation starts with an advantage. By definition his father must be fairly successful and therefore has an active social and political life, so the son partakes, from an early age, in the normal activities of life and has more opportunity to learn how to behave under a wider variety of circumstances than others. He also has more opportunity to hear men discussing affairs and thus gather information that will be useful to him when he makes his own way in the world. There is, however, a corresponding drawback; his defects, as well as his good qualities, will be known to a far wider audience. But whether his opportunities are wide or limited his reputation is of his own making — it is on his own public behaviour that he is judged.                               A girl's reputation is rarely as public, but it is equally important. The Rwala say that honour comes through women and while they are thinking primarily of sexual honour the phrase includes all female virtues such as the ability to run the household economically and efficiently, obedience, cheerfulness, hard work and the loving upbringing of children. It also includes the virtues of generosity and bravery. Quite apart from personal generosity a girl should materially aid her father's, brother's or husband's reputation for generosity and hospitality. This means that she must not only provide food in more than adequate quantities for visitors (by borrowing [Page 45] from neighbours if need be) but must develop the difficult skill of acting host in the man's place if guests arrive unexpectedly when her menfolk are absent. She must feed and entertain the visitors on her own, but in such a decorous manner that she may not later be reproached. The virtue of bravery is highly prized. It is perhaps more akin to fortitude and hiding the emotions in public than physical bravery. The stoicism of Rwala women is extraordinary. One elderly women related how her eldest son was killed in a riding accident while she was entertaining guests. This was not allowed to affect her treatment of her guests at all. On another occasion she had overnight visitors. Two of her children died during the night (probably from 1918 influenza) but this was concealed from the guests for the remainder of their stay and they only discovered much later. Her correct behaviour enhanced not only her own personal reputation but that of her husband and her natal family. In fact, it is stories like this that give the Rwala the reputation of being ‘very Bedu’ among slaves and peasants. This sort of behaviour is by no means confined to a ‘golden age’ in the past. Recently a woman was divorced by her husband, over the telephone without any warning: the reason was her husband's political ambitions and had nothing to do with her. As a result she had to abandon her children, aged four years, two years, and six months, with little prospect of seeing them again for years and with even less likelihood of herself marrying again. I met her two days after her divorce: she was chatty, cheerful and dressed up in her best (because she was visiting) and it was only slight lines of strain around the eyes and mouth that belied her manner. (This story has a happy ending. The husband's ambitions came to nought and the couple are now happily remarried.) Neither of these women is exceptional and they illustrate quite well the sort of qualities that enhance a woman's reputation.                  In part a woman's reputation is important because the upbringing of daughters devolves on her almost entirely. Girls just do not have the wide-ranging public life of boys, so their social models are restricted to their mother and other close female relations. For this reason, if no other, the reputation of a woman's family is of great importance.                            A man from the Hazza' three-generation ‘ibn amm’ fell in love with a girl of settled, semi-peasant origin. There was nothing against the girl except this — her parents were respected, well-to-do landowners and her father was the sheikh of a recently-settled part of a Bedu tribe. However, she was unsuitable in terms of general background for a Rwala sheikh. As the man was fully adult the marriage could not be prevented although his close relations tried their best to dissuade him. The consequences for the children of this marriage have been marked. The daughter, an exceedingly pretty girl, cheerful, competent and of high personal reputation, has not been allowed to marry into the Sha'alan. Several young men have been attracted but their fathers forbade the match, nor would the girl's half-brother (the father is now dead) give his consent. He was quite clear as to the reason: ‘If she married into the Sha'alan and the marriage went sour for any reason, she would have her mother cast in her face.’ She has subsequently been married elsewhere — to a business man of similar mixed parentage. Another man has a poor reputation, apparently from childhood; he is quarrelsome, self-indulgent and mean. His daughters, too, have poor reputations, partly inherited, partly acquired. They are unhelpful, rude to [Page 47] their mother, lazy and constantly bickering. (This is from personal observation.) According to their cousins, they are also forward with young men at school (they live in a city) and go out of the house unescorted by a brother or male salve or even alone. At least two are above marriageable age but no husbands or inquiries have been forthcoming; in fact it is widely known that their close relations have refused even to consider marrying them. The eldest girl is married to a f.f.b.s. who has a similar low reputation. I know this man's father and brother for a long time before I know of HIS existence. I never discovered why his reputation was so low, for his family refuse to discuss him — for them he no longer exists. He is said to be working as a labourer in Kuweit, which is an unlikely occupation for a close member of a very influential family. While pursuing this topic my wife asked, apropos two particular women, whether they had always been bad-tempered and complaining or if it was because they had been married to men of low reputation. The answer was immediate and unanimous; ‘Oh, they were married to those men because no one else wanted them — they were always like that.’                                 Many facets fit in with this explication of the woman's position. One of the most striking features of Bedu life is the division into public and private spheres, symbolised by the division of the tent into the men's side, which is public, and the women's side, which is private. By and large, public life means life beyond the three-generatioin ‘ibn amm’ and, like public life anywhere, it demands a certain amount of posturing, stating of principles and positions and impression-management. In furtherance of these, preposterous claims may be made, self-importance inflated and honour (in its widest sense) invoked. Under these circumstances it is only too easy for the gauntlet to be thrown down and for violence to ensure. Violence very rarely breaks out immediately (except verbally), but that it is likely to do so is shown by the extreme care men take never to indulge in anything but the idlest and most generalised chat before coffee has been served. Coffee formally signifies that the visitors are guests, and guests are inviolate. Should a visitor, in times of tension, refuse coffee, an air of uneasiness and apprehension pervades the meeting, and men shift around, ease their holsters and make sure that their gun-arm is unrestricted. When public life can so easily erupt into violence and where men's reputation is partly based on a propensity to controlled violence, it seems sensible that women, who are the reproductive assets of the whole group, not only biologically but genealogically was well, should be kept out of public life altogether. The equation of public life with violence is balanced by the equation of private life with peace and quiet, and this is not a theoretical construct. Any manifestation of violence on the women's side of the tent is strongly deprecated; even arguing is frowned upon. When a male servant stabbed another the entire population of the encampment felt a sense of outrage because the stabbing had taken place in the muharram, literally the ‘sacred place’, which is the Rwala term for the women's side of the tent. Nobody cared one way or the other about the participants (they were non-Bedu), but it was felt that the muharram had, quite literally, been desecrated and the tent wasn't moved to a new spot only because it wasn't actually possible. For those living in an encampment the whole area takes on some of the attributes of the muharram. When my wife and I had a rather loud and acrimonious argument about an academic interpretation, we were reprimanded, in private, by the sheikh's mother. Fighting between members of [Page 62] the same encampment is deplored and heavily discouraged, for a collection of tents is considered to be made up of members of an ‘ibn amm’, even where this is quite contrary to reality. A goum is a genealogically heterogeneous agglomeration but it partakes of the nature of an ‘ibn amm’ in that it has an identity of interest and the same peaceful and private considerations are expected to apply. Private matters are never discussed in public and this principle extends to the whole goum. If a stranger asks the whereabouts of so-and-so, the invariable answer is ‘I don't know.’ This is one of the earliest lessons a child learns — strangers are public and mean trouble and trouble within the encampment is to be avoided.                                 This is the extreme of an important function of women. Not only do the advertise dishonourable behaviour of the grosser sort, not only do they play a major part in maintaining, increasing and disseminating men's reputations, but they also cut men down to size. We have seen how a man, in building a reputation, must entertain frequently. At any public feast food must be abundant, for numbers are never certain. Moreover, the women who do the cooking must be fed and also their neighbours, sisters, female visitors or any female helpers. As a general rule of thumb if under twenty men are expected, enough food for double the expected number must be provided. For larger numbers an extra 50% margin must be allowed; i.e. if sixty men are expected you allow for ninety. The quality of the food is not very important but usually sheep and rice is served, one sheep for every ten adult males (excluding servants). Young men and boys eat at the second sitting, so one sheep feeds about twenty. The remains are for the women with the addition of the ribs and neck, which are usually kept back. If the man, who always buys the food or slaughters the sheep, has miscalculated or if he is showing off (i.e. trying to increase his reputation for generosity above its real level), this is readily apparent — the food may be sufficient for the men (although the appearance of neck and ribs is indicative), but there will not be enough left for the women. And this cannot be concealed. A miscalculation happens to all from time to time, but if there is consistently too little to satisfy the women, the man's reputation for generosity and hospitality will diminish and this will rapidly spread along the women's social network, which is extensive. Public life demands that a man should indulge in some self-aggrandisement and
Plate 3. Women preparing food for a feast
[Page 65] impression-management; it is the women who see that no one in the encampment believes it too implicitly. A brother reports some statement to his sister, a woman overhears a boast from the men's side of the tent, or a husband comments on some man's behaviour; immediately the woman starts to relate it to other reports and observations from her own private network. Clearly this does not apply to impression-management before strangers, which the women aid and abet; it is only if one of her immediate family is in danger of being taken in by such claims. Perhaps a man wishes, for private reasons, to give the impression of being a slick trader who consistently get better prices than his colleagues. If it is untrue it will be immediately apparent to the women. His feasts won't support his supposed wealth, nor will his wife's and daughter's clothes: the question immediately arises, is he mean, doesn't he care for his wife and daughter or is he simply a liar? Whatever the cause the women will known and they will tell their menfolk and the impostor's reputation will rapidly diminish. At one encampment there was a man who consistently gave the impression that it was he, and he alone, who badgered the bureaucracy into providing schools, arranged for the building of new houses and was the mainspring behind the development plans. This was a half-truth; he did do a lot but he was helped and backed up by other men whom he never mentioned. His pretensions were punctured by the women, who were in a position to compare the different private reports, and they took to referring to him as ‘The Emir’ as a gentle form of ridicule. He became a figure of fun to many, though I don't think that he ever realised. Women can similarly bolster their husband's reputation by letting private acts of generosity be known, by displaying the jewellery given them (though this has another function as well), by keeping the tent neat and clean and in good repair, by being generous themselves to female visitors or indigents or by disseminating the true facts of some action that man has modestly dissembled. In short, women bring a sense of reality to the posturings of men, posturings that are intended to impress outsiders but at the same time may be misleading to others; the public image is not down-graded but the private reputation within the group is made to conform to reality. The women play the major part in this mechanism for the very simple reason that men rarely have the opportunity to gossip together in private. Unless very closely related, they must meet in the public side of the tent and as soon as any man at a loose end see sthem he will join them, thus destroying the privacy. And there are always men at a loose end, particularly old men who spend a lot of time looking for someone to chat to — the Bedu hate to be alone.                                             Women are not only concerned with promoting their husband's reputation nor with assessing the reputation of others; they have their own reputation to consider as well. We have seen on what a woman's reputation is based; after marriage this can be augmented or decreased by the part she plays in her husband's success. She also indulges in a little impression-management of her own, demonstrating the regard in which she is held by her husband by displaying the clothing and jewellery that he gives her. God clothes and jewellery show not only regard but also trust, especially the gold, for this is traditionally the family's bank balance. Once it has been given to the woman it is hers absolutely and the husband cannot reclaim it should she decide to leave him or if he divorces her. Thus it becomes not only a symbol of her husband's success and generosity but also a demonstration of his trust. A lack of jewellery can only imply a lack of cash or a lack of trust. The exact state of a family's finances are fairly generally known and poverty is nothing to be ashamed of, but a lack of trust for a wife leads one to suspect that her reputation is in some way at risk. She must be either disliked or incompetent and both reflect negatively on her reputation. The same applies to daughters. Nubile girls spend much time on their appearance and accoutrements, not so much from vanity, although this comes into it, but to demonstrate to their peers that their fathers and brothers have a high opinion of them. The girls invariably report back to their families about the dresses and jewellery of their friends, so good clothes and jewellery help to spread not only the girl's reputation but her natal family's reputation as well. There is an interaction between the reputations of husband and wife and this interaction (or rather the end results of their interaction) influences the future direction of the generative genealogy.                        This comes about because women are largely responsible for the education of the children. By this is meant basic education in what is acceptable, laudable or unacceptable behaviour. It is not that the men are uninterested but that they are frequently away from the tent while children under seven or so, especially girls, rarely stray far. In a society where the accent is so heavily on gaining a good reputation it might reasonably be assumed that children were constantly guided, nagged or exhorted into socially [Page 67] acceptable behaviour. In fact the opposite is true. This arises because although reputation is extremely important, autonomy of the individual is even more important. The concept of equality extends to children and while parents will make clear what is and is not acceptable there is very little attempt to coerce the child into following guidance. This emphasis on autonomy starts at an extraordinarily early age; no baby is put to the breast until it yells; a one-year-old is expected to feed itself from the communal dish and no one will bother to see that it gets enough — it is up to the child itself. A three-year-old falls over a tent-rope and cuts its knee; its mother will show no sympathy and will, if it starts to cry, merely point out that crying is shameful. (In reality a child of three or four will already have stopped showing emotion at purely physical pain — crying with rage and frustration shows spirit and is tolerated up to a point.) By the age of about five a child will have learned which actions are commended and which shameful and he will be long past the stage at which physical coercion might be used. Physical coercion must be distinguished from physical punishment, which is very rare and then only reflects extreme irritation rather than formal punishment. The sort of physical coercion is that used commonly by grandparents or aunts to teach generosity. A two-year-old is asked for some object that is dear to him, a skull-cap that was a present or a sweet, and if it is not given straight away it is taken with every appearance of finality. It is shortly given back only to be asked for again, and again it is snatched away if not freely given. This is conducted with the utmost seriousness and savage teasing until the child is reduced to near hysteria. But the lesson is learned early — it is better to be generous than not. Obviously the lesson is reinforced later when the tactics are used to a younger sibling, but direct teaching stops when a child is five or six. After that he (or she) learns from direct experience that he is on his own and is, from now on, directly responsible for his own actions and future. A seven-year-old who won't share sweets, won't help around the tent when asked or grabs the best bits of meat when visitors are present is scarcely rebuked apart from a mild ‘shameful’ — his reputation is in his own hands and he is responsible. From now on the only learns from the example of others and the most frequent examples are his own family. The result is that children are a direct reflection of their family's reputation and can influence it for better or worse. This extremely rapid and, to us, savage educational system is necessary because children of seven, eight or nine have real responsibility. A seven-year-old girl is expected to be able to provide unexpected guests with tea, coffee and creature comforts before she goes to find someone older to cook a meal — her family's reputation depends on it. An eight-year-old boy is expected to avenge the killing of his father — if the opportunity offers and there is no one else available he must, for family honour is at stake. This is by no means only theoretical. The eight-year-old son of the Emir of the Rwala, armed with a penknife and helped by a few friends his own age, attempted to storm the central prison in Damascus to secure the release of his uncle. No one though his action comic or stupid — [Page 68] it was generally regarded as absolutely correct and laudable, if somewhat misguided.                                               There is a mitigating factor in these heavy demands. The child who behaves badly or incorrectly can redeem itself by turning it into a joke. Verbal dexterity and wit are much prized and the child who can respond in this manner finds much forgiven. The witty allusion, the poetic turn of phrase, can transform momentary greed or thoughtlessness into an occasion for demonstrating intelligence and humour. The skilful child can even turn it into an occasion for teasing its elders about similar lapses on their own part. Provided they are witty about it (and there is some element of truth) they can exceed what would normally be regarded as the limits of propriety. Teasing is a potent weapon in the Rwala educational armoury. Its use is not confined to children but is widely used within the family to correct or point out faults. A very greedy woman is teased unmercifully about her failing, but in such a manner that she cannot take offence and is soon reduced to helpless laughter against herself. If you can't see the funny side and are unable to sit and take it, but react by losing your temper, all is lost, for you are displaying weakness and your reputation suffers accordingly. Teasing is usually used by women but I have been present when the men used it to reduce a peasant, who had contravened practically every convention, to a quivering, blubbering wreck. The extraordinary thing about this deliberately cruel performance was that it was conducted in such a manner as to be funny; no one was really laughing at the wretched peasant but at the puns and jokes and allusions used by the performer, which showed skill, timing and intelligence of a high order.                                        This rather tough educational regime is compensated for by the absolute security that children enjoy. Whereas we tend to cuddle and fuss over a child who has hurt itself or is badly frightened the Rwala only do so when a child is not hurt or frightened. Thus children, especially small children, are cuddled, hugged and played with most of the time. This behaviour is not confined to the parents or siblings; uncles, aunts, step-relations, servants or just ordinary casual visitors all take part. Small boys, sticky with sweets and running noses, are warmly kissed; sodden, puking babies are dandled on expensively clad knees or pressed to velvet-covered bosoms. Nor is it only small children who enjoy close physical contact. Until puberty, the elderly and close relations hug and kiss and cuddle children, sitting by the fire in the evening, lying around chatting during the day or taking them into their beds at night. This total, unconditional security, which has nothing to do with good behaviour, gives the children a very great degree of self-confidence and sufficient assurance to take their autonomy very seriously. Because approval doesn't need to be sought, because support can be taken for granted, children make their own decisions without, as it were, having to look over their shoulders. Whatever may be the parents' attitude in private, in public the children know that they are fully supported, not because they are children but because they are related. [Page 70] Frequently they are supported in their decisions in private as well. Seven-year-olds make the decision not to go to school after consultation with their siblings and their parents accept the decision. Thirteen-year-olds decide, on their own, to give up their job at a local garage and join the National Guard. In the past ten-year-old boys would make up a raiding-party entirely on their own initiative. Parents often are consulted, of course, but the decision is the children's own and no great effort is made to persuade them to change their minds. Such momentous decisions are made as a matter of course and can only arise from a well-founded self-assurance and belief in the autonomy of the individual. It is this aspect of upbringing that the whole system, moral, emotional and educational, emphasises and encourages. As the foundation of the attitudes is laid at a very early age and as the direct educational process is largely completed before the child is five, the women are responsible for the sucess of the children's upbringing. It is the success of the child in living up to the expected standard that brings reputation to the mother. The child who whines, who is indecisive, who relies on others, who is sly or underhand, who is ungenerous, who is idle, brings the mother no credit and both pay in terms of reputation. No wonder they're tough in those first, few formative years.                                The toughness doesn't stem entirely from principle. Women are very hard-working and busy and, as a young wife with two or three small children, a woman just doesn't have a lot of spare time: the children have to look after themselves and each other. The woman runs the tent; she makes it, repairs it and adjusts it to the weather as well as putting it up and taking it down. She collects firewood, makes the bread, plans the meals and cooks them, washes up, collects the water, makes clothes, quilts, rugs and pillows and keeps them in repair. She look after the children, doctors them and her husband and has to have a fairly extensive knowledge of herbal medicine, collecting the herbs in due season; she must be able to cope with broken limbs, knife- and bullet-wounds, and scorpion- and snake-bite. The preserving and storing of food is under her care, as is the butter- and cheese-making if the family has sheep; carding, spinning and weaving of wool are her concern, though not the shearing of the sheep. And she must be ready at any time to entertain her husband's guests and visitors or down tent and migrate. On top of this she may well be pregnant. Put like this, it is surprising that they can stick it, but running a tent is rarely carried out in its entirety by one woman. Sisters, sisters-in-law, cousins, neighbours, mothers-in-law, nieces and aunts are usually close at hand and many jobs turn into social occasions. As the children grow older they too help. From an early age they bring in wood and collect dried camel-dung for the fire; they fetch and carry and wash. Later they'll make the dough, clean the fireplace, sew the clothes, raise and lower tent-poles, put up the side walls of the tent and help to tighten the ropes. A well-trained daughter of fourteen or so can run a tent by herself with the aid of a younger sister, leaving the more skilled and time-consuming jobs, spinning [Page 71] for instance, to her mother. A competent girl of this sort will, if she is also cheerful, have rightly gained a good reputation and this will be reflected in the clothes her father provides her. A marriageable girl with a good reputation, from a respectable and reasonably well-off family, will have accumulated twenty-five to thirty good-quality dresses (made by herself), three or four gold rings, five or six thin gold bracelets and a gold necklace or pendant. Dresses are not cheap, nor is gold and each dress-length of material will cost in the order of £35 and upwards — a best dress may well cost £75–£80 for the fabric alone (1978 prices). It isn't money wasted. After the dress has served its purpose it will be passed on as an everyday dress to a younger sister or niece, cut up later into clothes for a baby, used to make cushion covers or a patchwork dividing curtain and finally disappear thirty or more years later as a worn-out kettle-holder or rag for cleaning the lamp.                              As I have said, the Bedu system is based on the premises of equality, autonomy and the acquisition of reputation. Thus no man has power over another nor can his authority outstrip his reputation. Economic wealth and inherited family reputation are admittedly variable but neither confer more than a starting point for a personal reputation. Indeed, in some circumstances great wealth and high inherited reputation are a disadvantage, for more is expected to such a man and he has farther to fall. In the end personal reputation is the basis of political power as far as political power exists at all. In a system where every man is equally free to follow his own bent and where there is no mechanism for coercion, the only political power available is the ability to influence the decisions of others. This rests on four factors: good information, the ability to give good advice, a reputation for sound counsel and an audience to influence.

"Stirling, A P (1965) Turkish village In The Nature of human society series (pp xiv, 316) Retrieved from https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=mb01-007","Specific accusations of dishonour or moral slackness, especially by known enemies, have little effect on a person's standing. But households, generally poor households, may become known as ritually slack, or worse, as careless of their honour, while others, sometimes also fairly poor, may conversely earn a reputation for morality, or for nobility and generous conduct. These two extremes apart, the majority of villagers are impossible to distinguish in terms of morality and honour. Moreover, the scales or factors influence each other in complicated ways; indeed, they are not in practice always distinguishable. The word iyi, for example, is used both for a morally good person, and for a moderately well-to-do household. Theoretically a well-off man can be wicked and a good man poor. Yet there is always an implication in village thinking that to possess the physical means to live respectably confers moral respectability, and to be squalidly poor is morally disgraceful. Theologically, a link between the two meanings is provided by the theory that God rewards the virtuous and punishes the wicked in this life; or alternatively by a much less Islamic doctrine loudly pronounced by a successful sheep breeder from Elbaşı, who preached that wealth was the result of virtuous hard work and foresight, and poverty of sloth and neglect. In the context of rural Turkey I found his version of the protestant ethic unconvincing. Wealth and morality affect each other in a more practical way. On the one hand, the possessor of a commanding position can get away with minor [Page 234] or even not so minor transgressions without his reputation suffering. If a man has been to Mecca, is pious in word and deed, and judiciously generous, the fact that he has robbed his sisters' sons of their inheritance is unlikely to be mentioned. On the other hand, the less a man has the lower is his rank and the less he has to lose by public dishonour, so that the poor are generally more shameless than the rich. In the middle of the scale even considerable differences of wealth between one household and another were less important than honour, decency, neighbourliness and position within a lineage. One of my informants was a very poor man, but he was respected if not liked because he was given to showing a chip on his shoulder. One very poor old man who peddled with a donkey was treated with politeness because of a reputation for goodness and piety. The religious scale correlates least with the others. A reputation for genuine religious knowledge carries great weight even for a poor and unimportant man. Yet on the whole it is the more respectable households which insist on a proper religious training for their children, and among which the few who have had formal religious training are found. The elderly are in general [Page 235] more pious in their personal conduct than the young, and it is only the wealthy who can afford the greatest religious glory of all — the journey to Mecca.The guest room groups are fairly constant (p. 240) and thus the order is one among regular associates. People cannot make claims for themselves, but if they are afraid of being slighted in a given guest room then they avoid it. The mosque on the other hand is a meeting place for all the village. In a mosque people stand in long parallel lines, precisely to symbolise the equality of all before God. Yet the senior men always stand in the front row and the place of honour is in the centre. In this context, age and a religious reputation count highly. Young men and boys stand at the back. But in the middle rows the egalitarian principle of Islam works, and in any case late-comers have to remain at the back, unless they are visitors to the village of particularly high rank, in which case they may be ushered silently forward.

Despite the ideal attitude commanding a person to mind his own business, the common expression of this latent hostility is through malicious gossip and backbiting. Such expression, however, is confined to good friends and older men who are not apt to carry the calumnies back to the subjects. Young men and most women show a strong and consistent reluctance to gossip or criticize, and it is only in an unguarded moment or during intoxication that their feelings are permitted escape. The careful control on the expression of hostility is related to the Kaska Indian's great fear of giving offense to people and thereby damaging his own reputation. Old Man illustrated this tactfulness abundantly. He felt that Old Lady Metša had to be given a good funeral for fear of otherwise offending her daughter, Lady Suza. Following the death of her mother the latter was received in Old Man's house as a temporary accommodation, but the old man soon regretted his action as he began to perceive that Lady Suza and her youngest son, Donald, were depleting his stock of grub. He was extremely reluctant however, to take any action that would give offense. Instead he complained to the ethnographer of his guests' eating habits and criticized young Donald's laziness. A large part of his resentment was expressed in the socially permitted form of tormenting the latter youth for his indifferent work habits. The strongly developed practical interest in adaptation leads the Indian to neglect beauty and to be unresponsive to perfectionism as an end in itself—that is, above and beyond the degree required for utility. Embroidery on moccasins, mittens, and gloves is reduced to a minimum or often lacking. Only one or two women enjoy a reputation for fancy sewing, although many more are acknowledged as skillful, practical dressmakers. Oars are particularly crude and unfinished. Experiments made to deduce the emotional aspects of cultural products in connection with clothing and housing consistently revealed qualities of simplicity and nonperfection. Mittens, moccasins, and children's underwear, without being fitted to the wearer's dimensions, are cut with a general impression of size, allowing a little extra so that the final product is always somewhat larger than necessary. The style is baggy, the garment only crudely shaped to the body. Analysis of several log cabins reveals a striking lack of perfectionism. In one cabin some roof poles are partly hewed while many are not hewed at all. Where the logs join at the corners they are often not all sawed off to equal length. Another cabin is only half floored. The interiors of most houses are not painted or otherwise finished. Such housing style permits the inference that the people's primary concern is with utility, adequacy of a structure being defined primarily in terms of the building's use for the obvious function of weather protection. Thus we find walls lined with cardboard to keep out drafts, and moss chinking far more prevalent than the more finished-looking chinking with pole cleats which many white men use. It may be pointed out, however, that the increasing use of mill sawed lumber, which is easier to manipulate than logs, is resulting in larger and, in some cases, more finished looking cabins. While the neglect of nonfunctional artistic production may be partly determined by the fact that Kaska society has not been able to develop leisure time patterns of self-expression, any total picture of this neglect must also take into consideration the dominant motivation toward utility. It is consistent with configurational thinking that such personality values should be developed in members of a society forced to live under rigorous environmental conditions, where energy has to be largely confined to adaptation. The very fact of repression indicates that aggressive impulses are intolerable to the ego and therefore denied. That individuals deny their hostility is evident from the conscious attitudes strongly stressing the ideal of warm human relations and condemning violence. Dreams often reveal quite a different tenor of thinking. In a person like Old Man, who is frequently occupied in forestalling drunken aggression and who enjoys a reputation for pacificity, there are many examples of dreams expressing unconsciously motivated hostility. One example may be given here. Together with the tendency to remain aloof from disturbing situations which threaten the resources of the personality, a related objective of the detached person is to bridge the gap separating him from others. We have already discussed attitudes toward warm human relations in connection with deference and dependence. For the former motive it was pointed out that by avoiding hostility the Kaska do not so much seek love as they avoid the loss of love, while dependency produces ambivalent feelings in a person who fears that the care and protection he desires undermine his self-sufficiency. To these difficulties, that stand in the way of the egocentric personality's search for love, we must now add the anxiety which warm human relations invite because of their conflict with emotional isolation. Withdrawal of love in childhood not only sets up a barrier against any close interpersonal relationships but also instigates unconscious “affect hunger,” or a search for the unacceptable satiation of affection. Passive receptive (oral) trends, expectation of secondary gains from illness, and a reputation for generosity are some previously mentioned means by which the Kaska seek to satisfy affectional insatiety. One oral trend of pronounced emotional significance, alcoholic drinking, deserves further consideration. If the Kaska child's emotional rejection sets up affect hunger, we can understand the role ascribed to alcoholic intoxication as dulling “the pain of loneliness and [putting] the alcoholic in a state where he can fantasy love, at least.” The idea of reincarnation may also serve to fulfill unconsciously the unstilled longing to overcome personal isolation. Such a belief, it has been pointed out, may be a symbolic means of fulfilling persistent longings to bridge the gap between mother and child and to deny the even more final interpersonal isolation that follows death. Ambivalent attempts to assuage affect hunger through sexual relations will be discussed below in connection with sexual constriction. Before we can adequately comprehend the phenomena of sexual constriction in the light of emotional detachment, we must review what has already been said about the relations of men and women, adding emotional isolation to the other motives entering into these relationships.",NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FEMALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1392f39460,nd12-001,nd12

"Foster, M W (Morris W (1991) Being Comanche: a social history of an American Indian community Retrieved from https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=no06-039","Hoebel noted that “personal power was the recognized basis of social relations between men” (1954:137) but what Hoebel called “personal power” was in fact social face. In his descriptions of Comanche leadership, Hoebel (1940) repeatedly made the point that a Comanche war leader became one through feats in battle, with no formal installation, term, or even office. In other words, Comanche war leaders were those men who engaged in public behavior that enhanced their moral worth in the eyes of their fellows. Among such behavior was counting coup, refusing to retreat in the face of an enemy, and going to the aid of a dismounted comrade (Hoebel 1940:34–35). Each of these actions, when committed in the presence of other Comanches, contributed to the reputation of a warrior and carried over to a man's reputation once he retired from warfare. However, should a recognized leader decline to undertake any of these actions, he would lose face and his position of leadership: “A war chief whose nerve failed him in a dangerous position could retreat—by giving up his right to wear the bonnet. He could cast it off and flee for his life. But he was a man without status thenceforth, for he could never again regain the bonnet and its rank. Life certainly would have been miserable from that point onward. Men hailed him as ‘elder sister’” (Hoebel 1940:35). Neighbors (1853:130) observes that only actions in public gatherings contributed to or detracted from a war leader's reputation. Actions in private regions did not affect one's public face unless they were publicly commented upon in a manner that made them unavoidable challenges to one's moral worth. The same applied to “peace chiefs,” who were men who engaged in [Page 61] public displays of generosity (Hoebel 1940:18), thereby enhancing their moral worth in the eyes of others. Again, to behave otherwise in public gatherings would be to lose face and forfeit the recognition of other band members. Although Hoebel attempts to make a case for an institutional distinction between “war leaders” and “peace leaders,” these might better be labeled “focused-activity-group leaders” and “residence-band leaders,” with some overlap between the two categories. Individual warriors with a reputation for bravery could put together focused-activity groups for raiding or military purposes without possessing any special authority outside of those groups (Hoebel 1940:22). At the same time, no strict rule prevented a so-called war leader from also functioning as a peace leader for a residence band, and those Comanches with stronger reputations probably did so (Hoebel 1940:20). Certainly a successful war leader had to be not only brave but also generous in the distribution of the spoils of a successful raid or military encounter. Similarly, a man who lost face by not demonstrating qualities of bravery would not likely be recognized as a residence-band leader or peace chief. In contrast to transgressions committed in public contexts, adultery or [Page 65] homicide committed within the bounds of a family unit (that is, among persons who shared compelling personal ties and thus occupied a private region of interaction) was a private matter that had no public dimension even when known to everyone in the band. For instance, a man could kill his wife and face no public retribution because this was considered a private, family matter (Hoebel 1940:73). Even when transgressions such as adultery and assault were committed among male kin, kin relations were sufficiently compelling to resolve the breakdown in interaction, and the failure to address the transgressions publicly was not counted as a threat to one's face. However, when transgressions that could not be glossed over occurred among kin, publicly redressing the loss of face was often considered more damaging to one's face than the initial transgression. In some of these instances, Comanches committed suicide instead (Hoebel 1940:112–117). If, though, persons whose faces were publicly at risk were impervious to community opinion, Comanches had no resort to other, formal means to enforce those standards. Thus, while Comanches disapproved of incest, those individuals who were willing to ignore the risk to their faces could blithely engage in openly incestuous relationships (Hoebel 1940:108–110). Similarly, Comanches accused of sorcery could avoid public sanction by denying the accusation and relying on the subsequent damage to their faces for protection, as other Comanches were unwilling to take on someone with a reputation for antisocial power (Hoebel 1940:91–92). Divisions were important to Comanche social organization because, without the social regulation they offered, there were no public constraints on the actions of individual Comanche leaders and residence bands with respect to other leaders and bands. Comanche reliance on the reputation of a leader or leaders to hold an everyday nomadic group together meant that movement of personnel between bands was the rule rather than the exception (Wallace and Hoebel 1952:23). A Comanche leader who did not cooperate in mutual expressions of moral worth at a divisional gathering risked losing face, followers, and influence. In the absence of divisional gatherings, the Comanche community would have dissolved into residence band communities, each pursuing its own interests. Consequently, Comanches paid careful attention to divisional identities. These identities were explicitly signaled by differences in material culture such as dress, in dialect, and in cuisine, among other symbols. Whenever Comanches moved between residence bands affiliated with different divisions, people adopted the symbols of their new division: “[I]t was mandatory upon an individual to follow the customs of the group with which he lived in order to be socially accepted by his new associates, and this despite the frequent exchange of band allegiance and the interband marriages” (Wallace and Hoebel 1952:24). Comanches who also participate in church and peyote gatherings or who do not wish to become more deeply involved in the powwow circle use powwows as occasions for focused and unfocused social interaction with people to whom they are not usually physically present. Thus a peyote road [Page 164] man or a Christian pastor can attend a powwow and take advantage of the opportunities it offers for social interaction without “participating” in it and thus risking a dilution of his reputation. In fact, strong peyote or church people can have considerable social status at a powwow. Because of their strong beliefs, they are taken to be knowledgeable and thus to have a type of power. At some point, most Comanche families have need of one kind of specialist or the other. Peyote men, for instance, are still called upon to conduct curing ceremonies. Indeed, the change in designation from “road man” to “spiritual leader” may be interpreted as a way of generalizing the strength or power that a ritual leader takes from peyote gatherings to other kinds of gatherings in the community, such as powwows. Many church leaders, on the other hand, have come to be known as people who can “get things done” in tribal government and federal Indian agencies, also a type of power useful to Comanche people.",MALE,MALE,NA,MALE,MALE,MALE,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,MALE,MALE,NA,NA,MALE,399100a8f8,no06-039,no06
"Flannery, R (1953) The Gros Ventres of Montana: part 1, Social life In Catholic University of America Anthropological series (pp xiv, 221) Retrieved from https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=nq13-002","As explained by The Boy, a man had to work up from the ranks, so to speak, to be recognized as chief and as leader. “It paid to be prosperous and a good man. In the course of time people would look up to him as leader and other bands would be told that he is the leader. He does not ask for this distinction but, if he is prosperous and good, people recognize him. The band gets together and tells him: ‘You are our leader.’ He holds ‘office’ for life. As he grows old he might tell the people to select someone else, but, even so, they would continue to look up to him and to ask his advice and consult him. There are obstacles in the path of life, and one who would rise must walk around or over them. To be an acknowledged leader a man must have distinguished himself at war, but many who were known for their brave deeds were not necessarily in line for leadership. The kinds of things that would have prevented a man from receiving this type of recognition were the following. First of all, murder of one of his own band. For instance there was a well-known character who had [Page 33] an outstanding war record, was known to be courageous and not afraid to die, yet, because he was quick-tempered and murdered a member of his own band, he forfeited what would have been a very good chance of becoming leader of his band. Second, a man who had the reputation of being woman-crazy, of bothering other men's wives, or who was guilty of rape or incest, would not be selected as leader. Furthermore, a man who wished to rise should control his temper, be good to others and avoid lying, back-biting and jealousy in regard to other prominent men. If he had these qualities, and was eminent at war, he would rise high in public esteem and be in the running not only as a leader of a band, or of the whole tribe, but also as Keeper of one of the Sacred Pipes.” Such a family-owned herd would be differentiated and would ideally include pack horses, riding horses, and a few buffalo horses. The right of disposal over his own horses was, however, recognized for each individual man, woman and child. A man had the possibility of augmenting his own holdings directly by raiding the enemy. Because of the social recognition attendant upon successful raiding, as well as the economic necessity for controlling the means of production, the individual might actually devote in the course of a year more time and energy in pursuing this objective [Page 58] than in the actual production of raw materials. This was especially true of the young unmarried man who, though his ability to hunt was important, was even more anxious to establish his reputation for bravery. On the other hand, while utility was certainly an important consideration in the Gros Ventres' evaluation of goods produced by themselves, various other elements were taken into account. A horse procured from the enemy was perhaps the most valuable of all things to the Gros Ventres; aside from other considerations, a man would have risked his life to obtain it and that in itself lent [Page 80] value. Thus any object captured from the enemy, no matter how trivial it might be, was more valuable than a duplicate of that same thing obtained in any other way, and could be used to initiate an enemy-friendship, one of the most important of Gros Ventre transactions. A man who gave a horse, rather than or in addition to other items—to establish the enemy-friendship, to pay for the curing of a relative, to someone in honor of his relative, to his ceremonial grandfather for guiding him through the Sacred Dance, to wager in gambling, to show how much he thought of his brother-in-law in return for so simple a gift as the flesh of a puppy—would gain in prestige, for he thus established for himself a reputation for “being somebody.” A man would accumulate a surplus only to expend it as generously as possible in order to attain prestige. The person with a reputation for generosity rose in public esteem, and was in turn the recipient of many gifts, whereas the man with only one horse and only one wife could not afford to meet the demands for hospitality and for generosity in other transactions, and thus could not profit by the system of indirect and deferred exchange. While not all individuals lived up to the standard of casual hospitality, the majority seemingly did so, and business negotiations were usually transacted while visiting. The individual who dispensed food liberally could expect a return from others, although not necessarily the ones whom he had fed. Furthermore, if a man wished to sustain a good reputation he was expected to entertain well. It was customary, therefore, when fresh meat had been brought in for a man to tell his wife to cook and then he called out: “So-and-so, come and smoke,” to as many as he wished to invite. When the guests arrived he greeted each and assigned him to a place in the lodge, the most honored guests being seated in the back opposite the opening. After the guests had eaten, the host filled the pipe from a plentiful supply of “mixture,” and the smoking continued until the host gave the sign for dispersal by knocking the ashes from the pipe. When others saw fit to honor an individual, say for bravery in warfare, that person was supposed to give away goods in large amounts to show that he appreciated the honor; and his relatives would join with him in giving, thereby increasing his, as well as their own, prestige. Likewise in paying for services, such as those of a medicine man, relatives would “chip in” to the best of their ability, the one assuming the largest part of the burden receiving the greatest boost in public esteem. A person who impoverished himself by giving generously at such times would be sure that, with his reputation thus established, he would soon be the recipient of gifts dispensed by others in like liberality. Meantime, however, he could not afford to sit back awaiting the presents from others. He would soon lose his coveted reputation and be referred to as lazy, an epithet strong enough to bring tears to the eyes of a man who entertained any ambitions whatsoever. An ambitious man grasped every opportunity for distinguishing himself in as many of these ways as possible, for prestige depended primarily on a reputation for bravery, and competition between warriors was keen. The ideal man was one who had so many war-deeds to his credit that “his wrist would be made slim from being pulled up to recite them.” So great was the variety of circumstances under which a recitation of war-deeds was required, that a man who had accomplished little was of necessity ignored and doomed to remain a nonentity. Regardless of whether the man were the suitor, or whether the woman's relatives offered her in marriage, the marriage was validated through presents given by the groom. Traditionally at [Page 175] least one horse was included, but no given amount of property was specified nor did bargaining enter into the negotiations. Following the pattern of ostentatious liberality, a man could reflect honor upon himself by giving generously, and one with such a reputation was preferred over a poor or stingy one. Whatever the groom offered was divided among the bride's relatives. As one woman said: “A husband always gave something for his wife, no matter how many wives he acquired, because this is what makes it ‘legal.’ Then the girl's father and brother divided the presents. If the brother arranged the marriage, he would say to the father ‘Here is a horse for you.’ And if the father or uncle had been approached by the husband, then they did the same way. Sometimes even the father's sister was given a horse or something else when her niece married.”",NA,MALE,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,MALE,NA,MALE,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,dac59f3969,nq13-002,nq13

He is a high school graduate and a graduate of a junior college course in accounting. His work record suggests his ambition and his upward progression, for he started as a farm laborer, went to truck driving, then worked during World War II as a production machinist, completed his education, then worked for the Agency and, finally, was able to settle down to living off his several sources of income. He has never been out of the state except for short business trips. He spends most of his time on the reservation attending to tribal and his own business, and participating in various voluntary and formal associations. More recently he has become active in politics on a local level and by some has been ear-marked as a “comer.” His intellectual horizons are very wide, extending to a keen awareness of the difficulties faced by Dag Hammarskjold. His reputation is excellent and he is particularly esteemed by many Whites, although this esteem is not shared by all Klamath, which reflects only the factionalism of Klamath politics and, perhaps, the efforts of some to control a man who is too successful. In addition to being a minor criminal Weasel is frequently also the scapegoat for the aggressions of stronger men than he. He constantly asks for trouble, but has never given any evidence that he can back of his threats with appropriate force. His successful acts of aggression have always been sneak attacks, or attacks on feeble old men or young boys. He seldom attempts to avoid the consequences of these actions, and, indeed, is frequently not able to do so, because of his extreme drunken condition. He seems to obtain some gratification from the minor prestige afforded his performances in these roles, but this gratification is highly personalized and is not recognized as appropriate by others. It may be that he has been attempting to build up his standing and reputation within his own circle by acting out the role of a “dangerous Indian,” but it would seem that he has been singularly unsuccessful in this. One aspect of this behavior is his reputed skill with a knife. On two occasions he wanted to obtain vocational training, once as a barber, the other time as a butcher, both times implying that this would be a simple extension of his native talent. [Page -54-] Weasel was tested while in jail. He agreed to take the tests via an intermediary, and was anxious and tense throughout the session. But because of numerous experiences in correctional institutions he was quite suave concerning the test situation; he has had them in batteries, the MMPI, the Bender Gestalt, the Picture Frustration Test, some variant of the TAT, but never the “ink-blot” test. The jail situation provided no special stress, and the testing lead to the development of something of a friendship relation with the examiner.

Her mother in recent years has begun to assume a position of leadership in certain community activities, particularly recreation and education. Additionally, she has for long been the advisor for numerous relatives. Her mother verbalizes great fear and anxiety associated with this “getting out” and has done so only under considerable external pressure. Her father is a California Indian who is the model of local White conceptions of masculinity. That is, he is vigorous and physically powerful, a hard, reliable, steady worker in a logging company, a hard “Saturday Night” style drinker, absolutely fearless, and a masterful fighter in brawls.

About the year 1852 the Cheyenne and Arapaho returned from Washington, where they had gone to make a treaty with the Government of the United States. Among them was a Cheyenne of great reputation named Touching Cloud, who, because of the incident to be related, was afterwards known among the Pawnee as Iron Shirt. This man had in his employ a Mexican who could cut round disks from the thin frying pans used at that time. Touching Cloud had these disks sewed on a shirt and cap, the pieces over-lapping as in old-world armor. Soon after the return of the treaty party, the Cheyenne attacked the Pawnee, who were hunting buffalo. Touching Cloud felt so secure that he rode directly among the Pawnee. His arms were so stiffened by the metal disks on his sleeves that he could use no weapon except a sword but he used this so effectively that he and his party drove the Pawnee back to their village. The Pawnee were unable to explain the fearlessness of this man and talked of it among themselves. In the village was a young man named Carrying-the-shield who had not gone with the hunters. He listened to what they said and remembered something told him by his father, who was keeper of a sacred bundle. His father had four sons and gave them four sacred arrows, each a different color. The arrow received by Carrying-the-shield was red. In giving the arrow his father said, “Use this arrow when you are in great danger and it will save your life.” So Carrying-the-shield took the arrow and a bow, went out and met a party of Pawnee retreating with the Cheyenne in pursuit. The retreating party opened and let him through. Touching Cloud made ready to attack him but the youth shot him in the eye with the red arrow and he fell from his horse. The Pawnee “counted coup” on his body and found that he wore, concealed beneath his outer raiment, the metal-covered shirt made for him by the Mexican.

"Opler, M E (1941) An Apache life-way: the economic, social, and religious institutions of the Chiricahua Indians Retrieved from https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=nt08-001","It is an advantage “to get an influential person to talk for you.” While the go-between is simply an agent, he takes his task seriously and believes his success is a measure of his persuasiveness. Should he be ungraciously received, he is likely to feel personal resentment. Consequently, it is more difficult for the average family to return a negative reply to a “public figure” than to an ordinary man. Forceful conversationalists are likewise in demand for this office. Sometimes a person gains a reputation in this field and may be asked to perform this service a number of times, but it is denied that there are any “professional go-betweens.” Even affinal relatives may act for a young man: “I talked to my sister-in-law about a wife. I told her to ask a certain person for a wife for me. It took a long time.” Where a ceremony ends in failure, the shaman does not suffer irreparable injury to his reputation unless he has expressed himself too confidently concerning a favorable outcome. The result may be attributed to the fact that the shaman was not called in time or to the strength of an opposing witch. The ultimate effects of the rite are not always at once obvious, though it is hoped that the ceremony will pave the way for steady recovery. Should that recovery lag, it may be accounted for by the patient's carelessness in the wearing of the protective amulet, or by his failure to observe strictly the taboos. That a shaman may succeed in one case and not in another is conceded. “To “try” the ceremonies of a number of practitioners before relief from some tenacious ailment is obtained has been the experience of a large percentage of adults at some time in their lives. Reputation and social standing are significantly related to generosity, and, even if the individual gains no more than added prestige, he does not regret his philanthropy: “Gifts are given because we are sympathetic to one another. If someone needs food, we help him in a material way, for we feel that we are one people. We feel that way to a man who is poor. Giving is a great thing to the Chiricahua. A man can make a great reputation by giving.” It is the story-teller's use of appropriate gestures, onomatopoeia, and asides—in short, his gifts as actor and dramatist, which lend luster to his reputation. In order to keep interest at a high pitch, he does not hesitate to tease the less attentive members of his audience: “Once the old man was telling the whole bunch of us Coyote stories. It was just the time when E. was having some trouble with his wife and his mother-in-law. The old man thought he would have some fun with E. He made believe he wasn't looking at E., but he was watching him out of the corner of his eye. When he came to a part where Coyote has some trouble with his wife or mother-in-law, if E. wasn't looking he'd motion toward him and say, “I guess it's this fellow.” Everyone would laugh, and E. would look up. But by this time the old man would be looking the other way and going on with his story as though nothing had happened.” As the last quotation suggests, the authority of the leader is far from absolute; his position is little stronger than that of an adviser of excellent reputation: “A man called “leader” is respected all right. N. was a leader when I was young. If what N. advised when he was leader was in line with what the others considered their best interests, they followed him. The minute his ideas ran counter to those of the people he was directing, his ideas were not followed. He never had absolute control. No man would do what he said just because he said it.

A person who has acquired a reputation is expected to live up to it. Thirdly, power is dangerous. Failure to obey commands and instructions will lead to sickness and even death.

The two types of behavior attributed to her father and remembered with disapproval were winning at games too frequently, which was attributed to using his power to cheat, and spitting in other people's food. This latter behavior was attributed to jealousy and the wish to have the food for himself. Betty's case indicates the importance of personality traits in the genesis of a reputation for sorcery. Her aggressiveness toward other women, expressed both verbally and in stealing their husbands, was bringing social pressure upon her in the form of the accusation of sorcery. It is interesting that her aggressiveness came out when she was drunk and that the rest of the time she was quite friendly. Of importance also is the fact that she did not disobey her mother but allowed her to prohibit her marriage. In summary, the community felt that Betty was headed for a career of sorcery.

The sponsor announces the date of the pig market, which usually is set within one month of the announcement. Unlike a pig feast, the dedomai sponsor does not plan the event well ahead of time. Moreover, he does not breed pigs especially for the purpose of killing them at the market. Dedomai is simply an easy, quick outlet for a local, often unanticipated, “surplus” of pork. On such an occasion the sponsor usually kills only two or three pigs, whose meat he sells according to prices dictated by custom as well as the local state of supply and demand. Any Kapauku is free and actually encouraged to bring his pigs, butcher them, and sell the meat to “shoppers.” The more pigs slaughtered, the greater the success of the dedomai, and the more prestige for the sponsor. Thus, as in the case of the pig feast and money-collecting ceremony, the sponsor gains not only material, economic profit but also a reputation for being a skilled businessman and an influential individual. Such “nonmaterial prestige” is ultimately converted into an economic advantage and profit. In times of need, a man with prestige derived from previous success in the various types of markets finds it easy to secure credit or even the jegeka kind of gifts. Nature and functions of Kapauku credit . Kapauku extend credit to individuals for reasons having little to do with immediate monetary profit. The nature of the Kapauku conception of interest is mainly responsible for this state of affairs. Unlike people in our culture, the Kapauku do not believe that time is money. Consequently, if interest is paid in this Papuan society, the amount bears little relationship to the duration of the credit. The native stipulates the amount of interest to be paid when the credit is given, irrespective of the date at which the money will have to be repaid. As a matter of fact, there is never a thought given to the duration of the credit. Legally speaking, all debts have to be repaid upon the creditor’s request, at any time. Also, payment of interest is not legally enforced. It is only moral pressure and the fear of acquiring a reputation for being dishonest and not keeping promises, that induce the debtor to pay the stipulated amount, including the interest. This attitude toward interest is partially responsible for the fact that only rarely is it charged. Credit is extended to people because it constitutes the most important form of generosity and is a sure way to acquire great prestige. The discussion of the political and legal implications of extension of credit in Part II, “Botukebo Village as a Segment of the Kapauku Sociopolitical Structure,” shows clearly that we have to look in this direction to find the main reason for and the main function of credit. As stated before, debtors constitute some of the best followers and political supporters a man can have. Many follow the decisions of a wealthy and generous man in anticipation of credit or because his generosity promises security in the form of future loans in time of financial need. A wealthy but stingy man is not likely to become a headman. Thus generosity in the form of extension of monetary credit forms a prerequisite for the assumption of political and legal leadership in Kapauku society. There is an ultimate feedback from the sphere of politics into the province of the headman’s finances in the sense that he, being a headman, can easily borrow money [Page 350] when he needs it, can secure the best and most reliable pig breeders, and receives merchandise (pigs, woti shell, etc.) at bargain prices. His political and legal status assures him that a man will seldom attempt to deceive or rob him in business transactions.",NA,MALE,MALE,MALE,MALE,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,5ad8d36465,oj29-005,oj29

"Whiting, J W M (1941) Becoming a Kwoma: teaching and learning in a New Guinea tribe Retrieved from https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=oj13-001","Very near Yat's dwelling is one owned by Way (household 6, family line 3), a rather spindly, sneaky man in his forties, who has some reputation as a sorcerer. With him live his wife Mbwimbwi, his two adolescent daughters, Famba and Gwanta, and his two young sons, Merik, just weaned, and Kadowan, a few months old. Way also has taken care of his nephew, Gwamp, ever since the latter's father, Takawur, was driven from the hamlet for attempting to rape War's wife. A boy gains prestige from his sexual exploits. Although he must be careful not to tell anyone who might inform the girl's relatives, he frequently boasts of his conquests to those of his brothers with whom he is most intimate, unless, of course, the girl happens to be closely related to them. A lad who enjoys the reputation of being a successful philanderer gains the respect of his fellows. Although seldom praised to his face, he receives added motivation from hearing others complimented for their successful exploits. An adolescent boy is ready to become aggressive toward a non-relative at the slightest affront. Two factors operate strongly to produce this pugnacious attitude. In the first place, in his childhood struggles with his brothers he has frequently been told by his parents that he should fight for his rights. This social pressure toward aggressiveness increases with age. An adolescent boy who backs down when [Page 100] he is confronted by a non-relative, or who refuses to retaliate when someone has taken advantage of him, is severely criticized by his relatives. The second factor is closely related to the first. A Kwoma man gains prestige by being called harafa ma malaka (big older brother man), i.e., one who refuses to be taken advantage of in any way. A man is respected in his own community in proportion as he is feared in others. To become generally known as harafa ma malaka is not a wish prompted by idle vanity alone, for with it come specific privileges. Such a person has fulfilled one of the requirements for membership in the highest stage of the yam cult, and thus need not depend on others to plant his garden. His relatives will be eager to help him when he asks for their coöperation in an economic task, although many of them might find that they had more pressing matters to attend to if he were of low status. A man who has either achieved this status or shown promise of achieving it can also expect to find favor with the most attractive women both in philandering and marriage. Finally, his word will carry much weight in any controversy, either at home or at court. Although this position of prestige is not achieved until adulthood, a man starts during childhood to establish the reputation of being hard, and continues the process during adolescence. During childhood his aggression is directed for the most part toward his brothers; with adolescence he begins to exhibit his toughness toward non-relatives.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,MALE,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,5ab26325fc,oj13-001,oj13

By doing this they hoped to demonstrate their wealth, the earning power of their migrant kin and their ability to attract contributions from others, a proof of their generosity in the past (see, e.g., WT&E: 129–133). By this they gained a reputation, or as Ponams described it, a “big name”, langan mahan. This striving for reputation fuelled a steady inflation in the size of prestations, particularly of brideprice prestations. Thus, at least among migrants, each brideprice paid between 1978 and 1986 was larger than the one that preceded it.                    ""On its face this contradicts the idea that owners were able to benefit from what they owned. When asked why they allotted themselves no share of the catch, right owners said that this was because the catch was smaller than they would have liked, so that they did not want to take a share at the expense of others who had participated. In other words, they made the sacrifice in order to acquire a reputation for generosity. And the reason to be generous, they said, was that this would mean that in future expeditions they would have no trouble attracting a crew and thus no trouble getting fish.""

"Gustafsson, B (1992) Houses and ancestors: continuities and discontinuities in in leadership among the Manus Retrieved from https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=om06-010","A lapan, even if he inherited his position, did not, however, automatically gain respect and authority, but he had to prove himself in various ways: he had to gain a reputation for being a humble and generous man, a man to whom other members of the tali could come for advice. The most important task for him was to organize ritual performances and the large scale distributions of wealth between affinal kin, that followed upon rituals, and to plan for trade expeditions and war raids. The lapan was not responsible for ensuring that other members of the tali succeeded in collecting enough wealth. His only responsibility was to organize the occasions, when the [Page 8] distributions were to be made. However, by contributing a little extra, the lapan not only won the right to take more for himself when the time came for repayment, but he was able to demonstrate to other men in the village, as well as the members of the tali, that he was a generous man. If a lapan failed in these respects, the members of the tali might not support him in future activities and he would consequently lose prestige. A man was appointed to the lapan title; still he had to earn the confidence of other members of the tali, he had to gain a reputation for being a humble and generous man and a man to whom other members of the house community could come for advice. Since members of the tali were expected to come to lapan's house, his choice of wife also played an important role. Above we said that ideally children of cross-cousin's should marry. It was considered preferable however, for a lapan to marry a pilapan, the daughter of another lapan, who like the man had been trained for her future task while still a child. A pilapan could even, if there were no suitable men in the family, be appointed lapan. This however, has happened only rarely and never among the Titan. Working hard in the gardens or at fishing was not considered to be an important attribute of a lapan and his wife; what was valued above all was their ability to organize the activities of other members of the tali. To be able to initiate and to lead activities, it was also important for the lapan to have a wide network of relationships outside the house community. The lapan could count of the support of his moen palit and he could ask him for assistance in house community projects. It was, however, still up to the lapan to prove himself or else he would lose the confidence of the other members of his tali. A man who achieved a prestigious position by way of trade or sponsorship, however, could never challenge or replace the lapan because his prestige was of a different kind. A lapan did not gain his reputation as a leader through economic sponsorship. His title was sanctioned by the ancestors and his sphere of responsibility was related to the occasions upon which the men were to undertake trading expeditions and when they were to exchange wealth with affinal kin. In his position as leader of the house community, however, the lapan did not receive authority over other men. Since a lapan could not impose his will upon others, it was only through his reputation that his opinions would be respected and through which he could assure that he was consulted on important matters. A lapan, thus, was not an authoritative leader: his role was mainly that of an organizer helping individual members of his tali in their activities. When something extra-ordinary was about to happen, a ritual was to be performed, a trade expedition was to be planned or exchanges of wealth were to be made between affinal kin, then the lapan automatically became the leader who organized it. The role of the lapan as leader was thereby activated only occasionally, for example in relation to life cycle rituals and the collection and distribution of wealth. The kansolas of the Movement did not take over the symbolism or the articulation of the traditional leaders, but relied on a notion of leadership originating from European society. As it turned out, however, they were still using the same semantics as the traditional leadership. The kansolas, did not, in theory, have to legitimize their rights to authority through the efficiency with which they performed their offices, but achieved their rights solely on the basis of having been appointed to office. The authority of the kansolas, however, was not in fact automatically accepted by the villagers, and, as had been the case for the traditional leadership, they were [Page 241] obliged to legitimize their rights to exercise authority through prestations. Those kansolas who failed to show their ability to achieve results in economic projects, and who failed to gain a reputation as men of great wisdom soon lost their authority as leaders. The villagers would, in such cases, return to the old leaders, the lapans. The semantics related to the notion of leadership, thereby, had not changed, and the most successful leaders of the movement, as a rule, were men belonging to high ranking families. Men belonging to lapan families were trained already from a young age to become leaders and this ability was held to have been inherited from their ancestors. The lapans, thus, were those who responded to people's expectations of a leader. When all activities were to be organized on a cooperative basis, the qualifications of the lapans and the luluais were seen as more preferable than modern education or any experience which the younger men might have acquired through working for the colonial administration. The conclusions that we arrived at from the data on the Paliau Movement, was that changes in symbolism and articulation that have taken place in the leadership system, have not led to significant changes in the semantics of leadership. The same conclusions as those that emerged in relation to our discussion about the Paliau Movement, could, partly, be drawn about the leadership in the province today. A leader of the community, even though he is now appointed through elections, achieves prestige in much the same way as a lapan, by gaining a reputation as being a man of great wisdom. Men aiming at political appointments belong, as a rule, to high ranking families. The traditional semantics relating to leadership and dominance thus remains. Furthermore, the symbolic force of sanction remains in the spiritual sphere in the hands of either God or Win. Within the tali sphere, however, the force to impose sanctions has been transferred to the lapan who thereby has become more ancestral than he was in traditional society, when this power was held solely by the moen palit.",MALE,MALE,NA,MALE,MALE,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,MALE,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,5ea921c080,om06-010,om06
"Oliver, D L (1955) A Solomon Island society: kinship and leadership among the Siuai of Bougainville Retrieved from https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=on19-001","""Although the Siuai have separate terms for “generosity,” “cooperativeness,” “morality” (that is, rule abiding), and “geniality,” I believe that they consider all these to be closely interrelated aspects of the same attribute of goodness (nommai mirahu). ..A person is born “good” — or at least with a positive disposition for normal development of “goodness,” badness being acquired through exceptional circumstances."" (pp 78). “Explaining” native thought processes is usually a brash undertaking, but it is not difficult to account for this ambiguous use of the word pokonopo. When the Siuai speak of the members of a kinship group or of the inhabitants of a distant settlement, they refer to them through the name of some widely known individual in the group or settlement. Thus, Rovaro of Moronei village is a widely known tuki diviner (he is not a mumi); when men in distant villages refer to Moronei people they sometimes say, “Rovaro pokonopo” (Rovaro's people). It is logical to assume that the mumi with the widest reputation will be the point of reference when outsiders speak of the personnel of some region. Natives of northeast Siuai allude to the inhabitants of southeast Siuai as “Uremu pokonopo” even though Uremu, a prominent feast-giver, has no effective authority outside his own small village. A wandering, homeless horomorun is careful to seek rapport only with a man of renown, with one whose reputation as a feast-giver is already established, or with a younger man whom the horomorun judges to be a potential leader. (How the horomorun is able to judge that, my informants could not say very explicitly. “The horomorun merely looks at a man and knows that he will be a mumi.”) In order to attain rapport the horomorun frightens away the soul of his victim, who then sickens. First of all the victim's kinsmen try simple household remedies or engage the services of the local general practitioner. Then if these measures fail they send for a mikai who diagnoses the true cause of the illness and announces that the patient has been honored: “A horomorun has sought him out to establish rapport.” The mikai goes on to explain that the horomorun wishes to eat the blood-essence of such-and-such a number of pigs in return for which it will reside in the patient's club-house and help him increase his renown. Then, he adds, if the patient does not accede to the horomorun's request the sickness might prove fatal. Proper “maintenance” of a club-house, then, means giving feasts for it and in it. After a number of occasions like these, men from neighboring settlements will begin to say of the owner: “He is a true mumi; he gives large feasts.” And when they stroll about they will say more and more often: “Let us go to so-and-so's club-house; there's usually something going on there.” They are at pains to ingratiate themselves with the feast-giver, to defer to his judgment, to fetch coconuts for him, and to laugh at his sallies of wit. In this manner the owner maintains the popularity of his club-house and increases his reputation as a good host. And, it will be recalled, there is a supernatural parallel to this process: the more feasts the owner gives, the more nourishment is provided for his club-house demon, which waxes in size, in ferocity, and in loyal and protective adherence to the owner's person as well as property. Next, a would-be leader must have the ability to mobilize the support of a wide circle of kinsmen and neighbors; no matter how ambitious he is he cannot attain high rank by sitting back and allowing his sponsors to push him ahead. This capacity consists of several traits: Intelligence: knowledge of his society and culture, and capacity to make long-range plans of action. (In Siuai the more important action plans formulated within a man's society are made by the leader himself rather than by council.) Industriousness: continuous application to the difficult job of giving feasts. (This also calls for good health.) Charisma: ability to win adherents; in Siuai this presupposes: a local reputation for being morally “good”; and a special type of personality, including a capacity to initiate and dominate in interaction. Executive ability: a facility for delegating work and an adroitness in distributing rewards and credible promises of rewards. Mastery in the use of non-physical coercion: this consists mainly of the effectiveness with which an individual can focus public opinion upon an adversary so that the latter feels embarrassment or shame. (Threats of sorcery do not win adherence; and only a Hat-man can nowadays apply effectively the threat of physical coercion.)

The Paramount Chief's great storehouse was becoming more and more empty after each harvest, and in 1928 the magistrate at Losuia wrote to the Governor asking that Touluwa be given a pound of tobacco each month, which might help to raise his prestige a little.

"Parmentier, R J (1987) The sacred remains: myth, history, and polity in Belau Retrieved from https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=or15-002","In Belau political relations among villages are dominated by the actions of chiefly titleholders residing in high-ranking houses (blai). As a brief preface to a description of the title system, a few points concerning marriage, descent, and residence may be relevant here. The dyadic relationship between husband and wife is only the intersection of more important exchange relationships between the side of the husband and his sisters, on the one hand, and the side of the wife and her brothers, on the other hand. The essence of this wider affinal link is the asymmetrical presentation of food and services from the wife's side to the husband's side, with the goal of receiving valuables in return. A man's sisters are his ultimate source of financial strength, since they guarantee a steady supply of incoming wealth which he can use in turn to take care of his own affinal obligations. A high-ranking woman marries a man of at least equally high rank, since her male child, as potential heir to her house's title, will thereby enjoy the benefits of a considerable payment at the death of his mother. From the husband's point of view, marriage to a high-ranking woman may indeed be a “costly affair.” Not only will his reputation be elevated when he presents the required valuables to a distinguished house, but he can take pride in the fact that one of his sons will have a good chance of taking a high title some day. But warfare was more than an instrument of chiefly politics; it was also the focus of much of the daily life of the men's clubs. The untitled men of a village functioned as a standing militia entrusted with the protection of the village from outside attack, and they were always eager to win personal renown for skill and bravery. Successful warriors were known as the “pride of the village” (chedesiil er a beluu), and their victories brought honor to the village as a whole and especially to the chiefly council's reputation for political acumen. For individual warriors, raiding provided an opportunity to become initiated into the club organization, to advance in positions of club leadership, and to impress female admirers with their physical prowess. The following short song about Ngiratumerang also illustrates some of the nonpolitical aspects of headhunting. This Ngiratumerang was a young man from the highest-ranking house in Imeliik. An unusually handsome man, he spent most of his time in the company of visiting concubines, whose constant attention prevented him from mastering the manly art of war.

"Smith, D R (1983) Palauan social structure Retrieved from https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=or15-001","One day, he went fishing during low tide, and he saw Ngiraibuuch of Ngerbeched gathering sea urchins. Seeing this, he was moved with sympathy. Even more, Belas also knew that Ngiraibuuch had connections with Ikelau kebliil, of which Belas was the titleholder. Hence Belas filled Ngiraibuuch's canoe with fish and tugged Ngiraibuuch's canoe ashore. Belas helped him home with his fish. What fish Belas had left, he distributed to the noble women. From then on, every time he went [Page 133] fishing he would supply Ngiraibuuch with some fish. As the years went on, Ngiraibuuch became more dependent on Belas to fish for him, for Ngiraibuuch was getting old. Belas also saw that Ngiraibuuch got help in cooking the fish. For the fourth time, Belas was then entrusted with the position of Ngiraibuuch when the old man died. The people noticed and envied him for his constant good deeds and reputation. His deeds never ceased, regardless of the increasing number of houses he was supplying with fish. The relationships between Ikelau kebliil and many other kebliil throughout Palau were improving greatly due to the superior leadership of Belas and his fish. The people were enraptured to be led by Belas. Because of his unlimited capacity to help and supply people, he eventually was entrusted with ten titles or positions in various villages. Up to the present time, he is the only person known to have held ten titles or positions. Belas' accomplishments were facilitated through Ibedul's instructions [paraphrased from Kesolei, ed. 1975, pp. 5–6]. When members of the boy's family decide they will give a valuable for their son's wife, they send word of their plans to the girl's family. The girl's father or financial sponsor and mother begin to collect food for the exchange, while the husband's financial sponsor (generally his father) begins to look to his kinswomen or daughters for the requisite valuable. If the husband is no longer under the sponsorship of a father or if the father declines to give a marriage valuable, perhaps for a son for whom he has already made several such payments, the boy's matrilineal okdemaol is then responsible for providing the valuable. The amount given depends on the wealth of the man's family, their rank, and the rank of the girl for whom the valuable is being given. If the husband's family can afford to give an important valuable, both sides gain in prestige. A woman's previous marital history is also considered. If she has already earned one good valuable through a prior marital payment, she has a right to expect that her reputation as an “expensive woman” will now command an important valuable. In general, when marriages occur between high- and low-ranking units, a highranking woman commands at least twice the amount that a low-ranking woman can expect. If the girl is from a low-ranking family but marries into a high unit, only a small amount will be given. Conversely, if, as happens in modern Palau, a low-ranking man marries a woman of high rank, he is expected to give a very large amount for the privilege of marrying such a woman. Men who do [Page 148] not aspire to rise through exchange deliberately seek a wife from a low-ranking place, for such wives are cheaper. The man's matrilineage most commonly elects to pay the wife and/or children. Today it is more important that a payment be made for a man's children (ududir ar ngalek) than for his wife (chelebechel); people claimed that in the past the payment to the wife was the most critical. A valuable or American money, given as chelebechel, serves to terminate the relationship with the wife in a positive manner. The wife is now free to remarry. Recall that the amount of a special payment, as well as the payments a woman receives from serial husbands, enhances her public reputation and determines her ranking for “authority” in decision-making processes within her own matrilineage as well as the ranking of her children. Similarly, the “children's valuable,” kept by their okdemaol “in the name of” the recipient children, enhances their ranking for property and decisions concerning property within their maternal matrilineage.",NA,MALE,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,f34d9eb7d0,or15-001,or15
"Caughey, J L (1977) Fa’a'nakkar cultural values in a Micronesian society In University of Pennsylvania publications in anthropology (pp x, 180) Retrieved from https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=or19-026","Since enculturation produces people who take it for granted that character is measured by bravery, respectfulness, and strong thought, an adult’s sense of self esteem depends upon his own evaluation of himself in terms of these character dimensions. They provide him with ideal and feared self images. People want to think of themselves as truly brave, so most will behave in ways that are contrary to other aspects of self interest to maintain a sense of themselves as persons of good character. [Page 46] They are concerned with these dimensions for a further reason: they know that public approval or disapproval is determined by their character reputation. Even those few individuals who seem not to be strongly driven by the ideals actively seek to avoid a negative public reputation.              A man from another island acquired a considerable reputation for bravery. After he accidentaly blew off his arm while dynamiting fish, he screamed a good deal. When people heard this, they laughed in derision, for it showed that the man had only pretended bravery.
D.O., a leading figure in his dístrict, got drunk on another island. On his return he cursed many people on Fáánakkar including some in his own district. Eventually he was beaten by a kinsman. The next day another man commented as follows: [Page 47] “A long time ago D.O. stopped drinking. He wanted to be a man, he wanted to be a good person, he wanted to be respectful. And he was extremely respectful. But yesterday he was wounded by his drinking. People liked him until yesterday, but now some will think, ‘What is this? Is he turning into an evil person?’ They will be undecided about him.”                         Weak thought, people believe, will bring about a fate similar to that caused by cowardice. People do not want to be outdone by others or to have to borrow from them, because of the humiliation and shame involved. People fear such a reputation because they expect that others will deride them, openly or behind their backs, and that they will be despised and dismissed as persons without consequence. On the other hand, to be known as one who is strong of thought represents a highly desirable identity, because of the fear, admiration, respect, and deference such a reputation commands.  Resources in food are important in maintaining a reputation for strong thought. In order to complete many large-scale work projects, a man must give food to the people who contributed [Page 58] their labor. In several ways, food itself may serve as a medium of competition. Care in land use means that a person wins by having a good supply of choice food when others are short. The losers may have to come and borrow food from the winners, a further humiliation and loss. Some competitive projects involve the preparation of food caches ( e.g., huge pits of preserved breadfruit). People compete over their contributions to the food assembled at lineage and district feasts. Here, the main emphasis is on display; bundles of breadfruit are stacked up, large ceremonial bowls are carefully arranged, and tables are piled high with food.        ""Just as aggression against an individual is seen as arrogance and hence a test of that person’s bravery, so aggression against a lineage member is seen as an affront and challenge to the character of the group as a whole. A lineage that does not retaliate against slights aimed at its members will be [Page 72] regarded as cowardly, weak, and inconsequential. This reflects unfavorably on all members and the feared consequence is that evil outsiders will exploit the lineage. When a group lacks a favorably tough reputation it may be said that “there are no men in that lineage” ( ese wor mwaan noon ewe eterekes). While this phrase may be used for a lineage that actually has few men, it more frequently means that a lineage lacks men of power. Such phrases are commonly used in discussions about lineage reputations.                      A person who borrows from outsiders demeans his own character and that of his lineage as well. Such borrowing means that his lineage is made up of individuals who are so weak-minded that they cannot even provide for their own people. It is worse still when one lineage must borrow, as a group, from another lineage. This occurs when the people of one group must request the use of another lineage’s goods, such as its canoe or meeting house, because they have failed to acquire their own. In order to avoid such a disgrace and to maintain their reputation for strong thought, members of a lineage cooperate in large-scale work projects in competition with other lineages. The people of one group hate to see another lineage surpass their accomplishments or acquire what they lack. The man of extremely strong thought is a key figure in a lineage, whether or not he is the official lineage leader. He responds to the actions of other groups with appropriate counter plans and leads the lineage [Page 74] in competitive projects. When a task is completed, all members celebrate the collective triumph.              However, on Romónum it appears that neither the exclusive stress on respectfulness, nor the “prohibition of aggression” (Swartz 1965:37), nor the unaggressive style of social conduct were characteristic prior to the German pacification of Truk in 1903. In the 19th century, the people of Truk as a whole were considered highly aggressive in comparison to those of other areas in Micronesia. “As is well known, 19th century whalers and other travelers avoided Truk because of its reputation for belligerency toward outsiders, and within the atoll itself warfare was frequent. Although the Spanish held title to Truk from 1885 to 1889 and theoretically administered it [Page 174] from their base at Ponape, they actually did not govern the island. The bellicose nature of the people of Truk was a factor in the Spanish avoidance of the area” (Swartz 1965:17). My information about warfare on 19th century Fáánakkar clearly fits this picture as do the reports of Germans who lived on Truk in the early 20th century. “Truk was one big battlefield. Island fought against island, tribe against tribe. On one day two villages were co-operating; on the next day they were fighting each other. There was constant killing in an ever changing situation” (Bollig 1927:104). Evidently aggressiveness was also common on 19th century Romónum. In tracing the history of Romónum from 1850 to 1903, Goodenough notes that the history begins with a fight, and his account shows that it was permeated by assassinations, bloody feuds, sorcery battles, and warfare with neighboring islands (1951:148-161). Gladwin and Sarason (1953:41) provide additional supporting evidence. It also appears that this aggressive behavior was associated with an ideal of bravery similar to that on Fáánakkar. An example from Goodenough’s history of Romónum will illustrate this point. The incident begins just after assassins, who sneaked up to his meeting house and poked their rifles through the thatch wall, have shot and killed the chief Mwaatejinyk: “All of the occupants of the wuut fled in panic except for Wenejóg... Mwaatejinyk’s grandson. He picked up his grandfather’s body and carried it out of the wuut to prevent its falling into the assassin’s hands. Carrying it down to the north shore of the island, he proceeded west along the rocks on the shore and then climbed back up to... where Mwaatejinyk had lived.... Here Wenejóg buried his grandfather in an upright position leaving his head above ground and facing in the direction of the Pwereka 1 house (his enemy’s lineage center).... He then propped Mwaatejinyk’s mouth open with a stick so that his ghost would go and devour the Mwej people in revenge. This deed earned for Wenejóg a great reputation for bravery” (Goodenough 1951:155-156).    OTHER  ""He is brave, but he lacks strong thought; his thinking [Page 85] is womanly. He has not reached the age of manhood, however, and his character may change.” A young woman assessed her older sister this way: “My sister is a real coward. The girls of other districts berate her because they see she is respectful and cowardly. She just lets it go.”(pp 84) ""For men, “handsomeness ( aa teech) is regarded a factor in attracting young women, but bravery is important as well. A woman’s desirability is very dependent on her appearance, and an elaborate set of criteria are used in rating “feminine attractiveness” ( niyeech). (pp115) ""Young people readily characterize their peers in terms of the character framework and assume that they are trying to achieve a favorable reputation. A girl who had recently received a minor knife wound analyzed the behavior of her antagonist as follows: “She thinks she is brave, she wants us to fear her.” Both young men and women openly talk about striving toward the ideal. Asked if she wanted to be brave, one girl answered: “I really want to be brave. No, I’m not joking. In school if the other girls messed around, I would beat them. I would sit respectfully, but if they messed around I would beat them.” (pp 45) ""Cowardice represents a strongly feared reputation, partly because it is assumed that others will gossip about such a person and deride him: “If it is said of someone that he is not brave, he will be ashamed.” In theory, “It is better to die than flee from an aggressive challenge,” because “if you run others will deride you.” Moreover, as will be evident from several of the passages quoted earlier, it is also assumed that evil people will sport with and exploit a person of cowardice. Because they think he lacks the power to resist or retaliate, they will repeatedly try to take advantage of him. Children, young people, and older men and women all say that it is necessary to try to maintain a reputation for bravery in order to avoid such aggressive attacks. Bravery, on the other hand, gives a person an ideal public image not only because he receives admiration and praise, but also because others will fear him and hence will not risk his anger by attempting to take advantage of him. They will treat him with great respectfulness, because of his power and willingness to retaliate."" (pp 50) “If a desirable girl is married in the right place, she will bring significant valuables as well as labor to her lineage. Accordingly, young women are expected to try and approximate the cultural image of the ideal spouse: a young woman who is respectful, industrious in women’s work, discrete in sexual affairs, and attractive.""

"Firth, R (1959) Economics of the New Zealand Maori Retrieved from https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=oz04-004","Then, weaving was a skilled craft, and as such commanded the respect of the people. An expert weaver had a recognised social standing, so that it was the desire of every craftswoman worthy of the name to attain a reputation for neat, clever, and artistic work. Such an incentive, the hope of winning name and [Page 88] fame, was a very real factor in promoting the careful execution of the task and the elaboration of technique and pattern. The frank opinions expressed by other experts and even by the people at large were also instrumental in promoting good work. The expenditure of much time in preparation of the fibre, in even spacing of the wefts, and in neat finishing of borders was due to the desire for social approval of the finished garment. The quantity and value of these gifts tended to increase with the rank and hereditary position of the chief in the tribe, his prestige, and the following which he was able to gather around [Page 298] him. But the relationship was by no means one-sided. If the income of a chief was largely dependent on his prestige and influence and the regard of his people, this in its turn was contingent upon his liberal treatment of them. There were constant calls upon his resources. His slaves and immediate dependents had to be fed, he was expected to assist those of his tribesmen who came to him in need, a crowd of relatives — and the Maori bonds of kinship stretched far — looked to him for a generous repayment of all the small social services they rendered him, and for an occasional douceur as a mark of appreciation of their loyalty. When presents of foodstuffs were made to him by people of other tribes his regard for his reputation required that he should distribute a considerable portion of them among his tribespeople. For all gifts made to him a return was expected, of equivalent or even greater value. Even in the case of tribute, some counter-present, however small, was usually given. Thus if the vassal tribe lived inland and its conqueror near the sea coast, the former would perhaps send choice baskets of preserved eels by way of tribute, and be repaid by a portion of dried shark. The sanction which impelled a person to pursue this line of conduct was threefold — first, the anxiety lest he should lose all chance of exchange in the future and thereby be deprived of valuable economic benefits, then the fear lest his reputation should suffer by report of his failure to meet his obligations, a serious matter in a Maori community, and lastly the fear of witchcraft. The reality of the correlation between liberal use of wealth and maintenance of social prestige has already been made sufficiently plain; all that need be said here is to point out that of the double stimulus to reciprocate a gift, this was probably the more imminent and powerful. The fear of witchcraft was vague and problematical, and it could perhaps be warded off by proper precautions, but the loss of reputation was an immediate blow and could not be averted even by magical means. The immediate social background of this is not far to seek. As already mentioned, in the Maori economic life a distinct premium was placed upon generosity, liberal gifts, free hospitality. The practice of such virtues was greatly admired, it inflated a man's social reputation and prestige, it contributed materially to his rank and standing in the tribe. Proverbs, tales and the advice of elders encouraged such conduct. At various points in the course of this work we have been able to show how the purely biological drives to action, which in one way form the root of all economic effort, are reinforced or even replaced by social forces. In matters of work it has been demonstrated that the reward for effort is not simply the object secured or the material satisfaction obtained — which may indeed go to another — but perhaps even more potent, the prestige inflated or upheld, the reputation which the man gains in the eyes of his fellows. Social motives form the great spur to economic action. In the initial preservation of food or accumulation of wealth — both being culturally valuable processes — the community throws the [Page 494] weight of its opinion into the balance, through traditional advice and popular appreciation, and thus provides the due stimulus, even though such conduct is antithetic to the desires of the individual at the moment. The impulse for purely immediate physical satisfaction is restrained or inhibited. In this the rational aim of reserving a stock for future use is reinforced by the wish to enjoy the prestige which accrues to the possessor. But the social forces go further. It is in use and not in mere blank possession that value lies. And so proverbs, songs, legendary tales and the stream of public opinion all combine to extol generosity in giving, open-handedness in disposing of the wealth accumulated. In the apportionment of food, in the exchange of goods the dominance of this attitude has been proven. On the whole, then, the compulsion to work, to save, and to expend is given not so much by a rational appreciation of the benefits to be received as by the desire for social recognition, through such behaviour. The entire scheme of motivation in industry is thus lifted from the biological to the social plane. In this conversion of instinctive to cultural drives in the case of the food-producing activities of the human animal lies one of the fundamental problems for future economic study.                     ""Thus in the story of Paoa aforementioned, it is told how the real greatness of a young chieftainess Tukutuku was shown by her courtesy and generosity to all her dependents. This moved their hearts, and they brought to her as presents large quantities of food, such as dried shellfish and other delicacies, in order that she could show great hospitality to visitors.""(pp 133) ”In regard to the reception of guests, the wife made the arrangements for inviting and entertaining them, while the welcoming and speech-making was the duty of the husband. When a woman of rank married outside her own hapu, she held mana marae in her new home, that is, the authority to dispense hospitality to travellers on her own initiative. She would be endowed with these privileges by her husband on being installed in the house.""(pp 124) ""But to maintain his position the chief needed one thing more — wealth. Every man of rank had to be prepared to grant frequent hospitality to travellers, relatives, and visitors of note. A reputation for liberality was greatly sought after, and, conversely, a name for meanness and parsimony was a social stigma of the worst kind. The honour of a Maori chief was bound up with his ability to entertain lavishly when necessary. Many were the shifts resorted to in order to preserve one's reputation when some unforeseen contingency had reduced the supply of food available for guests.""

Thus competition took place to secure the reputation of being the best fowler in the village or district. The villages became interested in the success of their particular champions and pigeon netting progressed beyond a purely economic process to become a sport in which the glory of victory over others became the main incentive. The chiefs stepped in and pigeon netting became monopolized by those of high rank. Chiefs could command the organizing of labor to build the earth platforms faced with stone.

Seldom is the chaperonage exercised over the girl of average family severe enough to make elopement the only way of consummating a love affair. But the elopement is spectacular; the boy wishes to increase his reputation as a successful Don Juan, and the girl wishes to proclaim her conquest and also often hopes that the elopement will end in marriage. The eloping pair run away to the parents of the boy or to some of his relatives and wait for the girl's relatives to pursue her. As one boy related the tale of such an adventure: “We ran away in the rain, nine miles to Leone, in the pouring rain, to my father's house. The next day her family came to get her, and my father said to me, ‘How is it, do you wish to marry this girl, shall I ask her father to leave her here?’ And I said, ‘Oh, no. I just eloped with her for public information.’” Elopements are much less frequent than the clandestine love affairs because the girl takes far more risk. She publicly renounces her often nominal claims to virginity; she embroils herself with her family, who in former times, and occasionally even to-day, would beat her soundly and shave off her hair. Nine times out of ten, her lover's only motive is vanity [Page [104]] and display, for the boys say, “The girls hate a moetotolo, but they all love an avaga (eloping) man.” The young men do not settle as early into a groove.

Spirit mediums then could play a role both inside and outside the formal religious system and to the degree that they operated outside it they could be thought to seek prestige and status thereby. To be a spirit medium offered a way of obtaining a position in the social structure which a person could not reach by hereditary means. Now it is true that a spirit medium who was in frequent demand to visit the sick and had acquired a reputation for his therapeutic powers did acquire personal prestige. And the spirit medium who, as a vessel of a principal god, entered Marae in the panoply of scarlet turmeric pigment and leaf decoration, struck awe into those who saw him. But the Tikopia distinguished fairly clearly between the power of the spirit, and the personality of the medium; it was the former and not the latter that tended to be credited with social prestige. Again and again in a public or domestic rite I have seen a medium in trance state as the centre of attention being treated with great respect, his every word listened to with care. But before and after it he was simply a man, even a junior member of the household, and treated as such with no respect whatsoever. Some of them (bachelors, poor shiftless commoners, old widows) definitely carried much less prestige than many other folk who were never mediums.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,MALE,NA,NA,NA,4f44f0907c,ot11-028,ot11
"Harner, M J (1973) The Jívaro: people of the sacred waterfalls Retrieved from https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=sd09-034","The majority of young men interviewed expressed a strong desire to kill, not only to avenge the deaths of their fathers and other close relatives, but to acquire the arutam soul power and to become known, respected, and feared as kakaram. To be acknowledged as a kakaram, a man must have killed at least several persons. Early in his career, he does this by going on killing expeditions led by others, whether intra-tribal assassinations or the inter-tribal raids for tsantsa. As his reputation increases, he will eventually successfully organize and lead such an expedition himself, usually the more modest local assassination raid, probably against a specific personal enemy who is believed to have, sometime earlier, caused the death of a member of his immediate family. If he acquits himself well in achieving this assassination, especially as evidenced by firing the first shot into the victim, word will rapidly spread of his apparent power. Soon he will be approached by other men to lead them in killing expeditions against their own enemies. The kakaram, anxious to further his reputation as well as to gain additional supernatural power through more killing, rarely refuses such a request, even though it often means that he is agreeing to kill a fellow tribesman who is not even an enemy of his. As his reputation grows, the kakaram tends to dress himself in elaborate feather headdresses and ornaments when visiting other households or receiving guests (see frontispiece). [Page 113] Similarly, he adopts an ever more forceful and aggressive style of speaking when receiving visitors, meeting others on the trail, or in visiting other men. He conveys the impression of being invincible in every aspect of his public demeanor. If he has a son, he encourages him to become a killer also, and instructs him to the extent of taking him on assassination expeditions even as early as the age of six or seven years. Although such a young boy will not yet take part in the actual killing, the father brings him up to the corpse after the murder and has him fire into it, with the father helping him hold the gun. The wives of such a kakaram also are expected to outperform other women in making superior pottery vessels, doing garden work and other aspects of household labor.

They were, we knew, important persons in the Bush Negro communities. An obia man of reputation was not only consulted by his own villagers and clansmen, but men and women came to him from distant villages, when those who were nearer had failed them. It occurred sometimes that even from the Awka villages on the lower river, these Saramacca obia men were sought out—perhaps this was because of the same tradition which encouraged the buying of strange gods to enlarge the family pantheon, perhaps it was because of something which touched still deeper beliefs. How did a man become an obia man? From what we had already heard, it was apparent that here was something which approached the formal education of our own civilization, a form of education, indeed, which we pride ourselves is unique to our own way of life.(p 314) But obia is learned formally and slowly. An obia man may teach his own brother, or his sister’s ablest son, or his own son, even, what he knows, but the learning process will be gradual, for no man may disclose too much to an untrained mind. At times, however, an obia man trains men who are not related to him. He may himself decide upon a young man of promise to whom he cares to impart his knowledge. A considerable sum of money may be offered him by members of an influential family who wish to have an obia man of their own kin and who send a young man to him for training. In a dream or during possession it may become known that the ancestors wish a certain young man to apprentice himself to the obia man they name. (p.315)

The [Page 43] most noticeable divergences, given Sindóbóbi’s advanced age, were the relatively small attendance at each public event and the relatively brief time—eight days—the corpse was kept in the village before burial. But in addition, the threesisters who lived near our house made plans to go off for several days to their gardens upstream, and Dosíli did not cancel a four-day trip to Paramaribo—neither of which would have been considered acceptable behavior for the death of a community member in good standing. On the other hand, the rhetoric of mourning was one we had heard many times before. Our field notes contain numerous allusions to Sindóbóbi’s alleged evildoing. She is said to have performed rites involving the burial of live cocks (to increase her own rice yields at the expense of others), to have magically fixed her own daughter’s marriage basket (to prevent the husband from divorcing her), and to have called out curses that brought sickness and death upon her victims. Asipéi once remarked that “Sindóbóbi never washed in simple water even once in her life—all she ever used were óbia [magical] leaf baths. Whenever you walked by her house, you could smell the odor of the leaves!” Asabôsi was also implicated by association. People said, “Her only daughter. Of course she taught her everything she knew!” We know of a half-dozen people Sindóbóbi is said to have killed (supernaturally), and many others are said to have escaped only after paying her cloths and other goods so that she would stop sickening them. Her own sister refused to attend her funeral rites because Sindóbóbi had been found years earlier, through divination, to have caused the death in childbirth of the sister’s daughter.

The building of a house is the most important step in the process of gaining power, but an ambitious man also builds up his reputation as a dancer, chanter or shaman. Ideally, these ritual specialist roles are separate from leadership (according to the model of five siblings with interdependent specialist roles) but, in practice, personal initiative tends to be directed towards more than one specialist role (see p. 28).

He leads more by example than by threats and coercion. He can afford to be this way as he established his reputation [Page 16] for being fierce long ago, and other men respect him He also has five mature brothers who support him, and he has given a number of his sisters to other men in the village, thereby putting them under some obligation to him. In short, his “natural” following (kinsmen) is large, and he does not have to constantly display his ferocity People already respect him and take his suggestions seriously. Rerebawä is perhaps more typical than Ka aobawä in the sense that he is concerned about his reputation for ferocity and goes out of his way to act tough. He is, however, much braver than the other men his age and backs up his threats with action. Moreover, he is concerned about politics and knows the details of intervillage relationships over a large area. In this respect he shows all the attributes of a headman, although he is still too young and has too many competent older brothers in his own village to expect to move easily into the position of leadership there. The feast for Karohi-teri was essentially the same as the one for the Mahekodo-teri and Boreta-teri. When the dancing was over and darkness fell, the men began to chant again. The first pair of chanters had not completed their rhythmic presentation when the jungle around the village erupted with hoots and screams, causing all of the people in the village to jump from their hammocks and arm themselves. When the men had found their arrows and were prepared, they began yelling back at the unseen guests, rattling the shafts of their arrows together or against their bows and/or pounding the heads of axes against pieces of firewood or on the ground to make noise. The Boreta-teri and Mahekodo-teri had returned to accept the chest-pounding challenge and entered the village, each man brandishing his axe, club, or bow and arrows. They circled the village once, feinting attack on particular men among the hosts, then grouped at the center of the village clearing. The hosts surrounded them excitedly, dancing with their weapons poised to strike, then entering into the mass of bodies. Heated arguments about food theft and gluttony developed, and the hosts and guests threateningly waved their weapons in each other's faces. Within minutes the large group had bifurcated and the chest-pounding began. The Karohi-teri aided Ka aobawä and his followers, whose joint numbers were even further swelled when the Lower Bisaasi-teri rushed to the village after hearing the commotion. There were about sixty adult men on each side in the fight, divided into two arenas, each comprised of hosts and guests. Two men, one from each side, would step into the center of the milling, belligerent crowd of weapon-wielding partisans, urged on by their comrades. One would step up, spread his legs apart, bare his chest, and hold his arms behind his back, daring the other to hit him. The opponent would size him up, adjust the man's chest or arms so as to give himself the greatest advantage when he struck, and then step back to deliver his close-fisted blow. The striker would painstakingly adjust his own distance from his victim by measuring his arm length to the man's chest, taking several dry runs before delivering his blow. He would then wind up like a baseball pitcher, but keeping both feet on the ground, and deliver a tremendous wallop with his fist to the man's left pectoral muscle, putting all of his weight into the blow. The victim's knees would often buckle and he would stagger around a few moments, shaking his head to clear the stars, but remain silent. The blow invariably raised a “frog” on the recipient's pectoral muscle where the striker's knuckles bit into his flesh. After each blow, the comrades [Page 115] of the deliverer would cheer and bounce up and down from the knees, waving and clacking their weapons over their heads. The victim's supporters, meanwhile, would urge their champion on frantically, insisting that he take another blow. If the delivery were made with sufficient force to knock the recipient to the ground, the man who delivered it would throw his arms above his head, roll his eyes back, and prance victoriously in a circle around his victim, growling and screaming, his feet almost a blur from his excited dance. The recipient would stand poised and take as many as four blows before demanding to hit his adversary. He would be permitted to strike his opponent as many times as the latter struck him, provided that the opponent could take it. If not, he would be forced to retire, much to the dismay of his comrades and the delirious joy of their opponents. No fighter could retire after delivering a blow. If he attempted to do so, his adversary would plunge into the crowd and roughly haul him back out, sometimes being aided by the man's own supporters. Only after having received his just dues could he retire. If he had delivered three blows, he had to receive three or else be proven a poor fighter. He could retire with less than three only if he were injured. Then, one of his comrades would replace him and demand to hit the victorious opponent. The injured man's two remaining blows would be canceled, and the man who delivered the victorious blow would have to receive more blows than he delivered. Thus, good fighters are at a disadvantage, since they receive disproportionately more punishment than they deliver. Their only reward is status: they earn the reputation of being fierce.

These songs start very low, proceed with a distinctive and precise rhythm, and increase slowly in volume. When the troop stands up, they sing with such great volume that everybody in the village can hear them well. According to their haughty reputation, however, if there is any interference on the part of anything in the village (that is, if a dog should bark intermittently, or if somebody in the village should begin to sing) the Pepkahàk instantly cease even if they are in the middle of a song. The haughty Pepkahàk do not brook competition. They are either accepted as they are or they withdraw. It is believed that in prepacification times, a peacetime leader of a Canela tribe had to be a relatively young but proven warrior ( hààprãl). The warrior maintained his leadership primarily [Page 309] because others did not dare to challenge his reputation or take chances with the fierceness of his personality (W. Crocker, 1978:18) [III.A.2.k.(4)]. As he grew older and was less able as a warrior, he would relinquish his position in favor of a younger hààprãl leader while still acting as a respected counselor in peace or in war, supported by the Pró-khãmmã. It was likely that a village had between two and four such persons, and the oldest, if still respected and capable of leading in battle, was in command. If a Canela is proud of himself and wants to develop a good reputation, he can do so by observing high restrictions (Glossary), especially during the years just after puberty. If he keeps the polluting juices ( ampoo kakô ?-khên: something's liquid it is-bad: something's polluting liquid) out of his body, at least relatively so, he grows strong and capable; otherwise, he remains as weak as a preadolescent boy [II.D.3.c.(1),d] [III.A.2.q]. EXTENSIVE PERSONAL NETWORKS.—A frequent joke about Kaapêltùk is that he has few female relatives, having turned most of them into “other wives” [III.F.1], which is substantiated by his reputation as a consumate lover [III.F.8]. In any case, I know he can call on many women in the village to support him because of exchanged sexual favors, many more than most men. Moreover, his “other wives” [III.E.3.a.(6)] can and do subtly motivate their husbands to support him. In addition to these influences, his wife Atsuu-khwèy belongs to the largest longhouse [III.E.2.e.(2)] in Escalvado (Figure 24, BB-NN), as does Kaarà?khre's wife. Thus, Atsuu-khwèy can call on most of her longhouse “sisters” and they on their husbands to further his causes. Chief Kaapêltùk can also call on his own female kin ( hõ-?kahãy: his-females: a common expression used when talking about a person's influence) in his longhouse (Figure 24, TT-ZZ).                       Girls and women are allowed to be relatively soft and weak, though they are expected to be generous. Their main roles in life do not require the same kind of endurance against hardships and courage against dangers, as are understood in the term shouted between men: awkanà (bear up under the hardship, endure!).

Avarijú, a small man of about fifty years, was filled with seemingly boundless energy. His sharp wit, quick laugh, and repertory of stories made him an asset around any hearth. He had been born in Mboí Jaguá and had come to Itanaramí to join his wife. Before asserting himself as a tamoí, he had been known for his fortitude in the face of the larger society. He had once confronted a general during an official visit and could carry himself with dignity past the prostitutes and truck drivers of Igatimí. Avarijú was not given much respect for his religious powers when he asserted himself as a leader, but he developed his reputation with hard work, asserting kin relations and developing religious knowledge to attain the principal leadership of the tekoá of Itanaramí. As noted earlier, individuals receive religious power in poraé while asleep. Visions or songs appear to all sleeping people, but some people experience them more intensely, often speaking of traveling in their sleep to other worlds in the sky or under the earth. The method of access to these experiences is neither solicited from, nor taught by, religious specialists. Upon waking, some individuals who undergo these visions feel compelled to share their newfound understanding and power with the larger community. When poraé are repeated in religious gatherings, the [Page 104] individual begins to develop a reputation as a tamoí. A poraé is often multisyllabic, but it rarely is constituted of words and sentences. However, when explicated in religious settings, Chiripá use Guaraníeté, a ritual or archaic form of Guaraní with sound shifts, word roots that are not drawn from Spanish, and nouns (often animal names) that differ from those in conventional use. Thus, kyhá (hammock) becomes kyá, and akutipáy (Cuniculus paca) (a paca) becomes jaishá in Guaraníeté. After beginning with a single poraé to share with the community, Avarijú joined established tamoí in neighboring communities, developing his power and reputation from the association. To promote his divine inspiration, he adopted a life-style conducive to supernatural inspiration. He ate only foods “of the forest,” primarily kãnguijý (a fermented corn beverage like chicha ) and honey, but avoided game. He also used sleep to explore the supernatural through dreams. Night after night, for months on end, Avarijú alternated sleep with chanting until dawn. He would sing until his voice was only a guttural hum, then retreat to his hammock with a piece of manioc. After what seemed like only minutes, he would rouse himself, and his wife and daughters, to continue. His voice, carrying his visions, drifted from his house into the forest. People began to see him in a new light. As his repertoire enlarged, so did his stature and influence in the community. By diligently leading religious ceremonies, Avarijú was able to develop his reputation as a knowledgeable and religiously powerful individual, steadily increasing his level of influence within other kin groups. He periodically fermented corn for major celebrations and, in 1981, organized the first naming ceremony in the community in five years. Because the ceremony demands the cooperation of several tamoí, he requested assistance from religious leaders of Mboí Jaguá and Fortuna. His position was secured when these tamoí later solicited his assistance in return.",NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,MALE,NA,MALE,NA,NA,MALE,NA,4c265501a7,sm04-009,sm04
"Altschuler, M (1965) The Cayapa: a study in legal behavior Retrieved from https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=sd06-004","Problems in Courtship and Marriage. Many men among the Cayapa are reluctant to take the initiative in romantic affairs, but from time to time one finds among them men like Chapiro of the Río Camerones, who seems to delight in amorous peccadillos and adventures. Chapiro has the reputation of preferring married women with whom it is said he would make love, while the husband slept only inches away on the same bedding. He pretended to be the husband and apparently deceived the wives with a large measure of success for a time. In the Cayapa view, a conflict of interest in the person of Lorenzo, the father of the seduced woman, and Lorenzo, the official, does not exist. The facts [Page 133] of the case were clear, and a witness was present. It is of interest that Pablo's wife seems to have convinced everyone of her innocence in the affair and that she had been truly hoodwinked. Chapiro's reputation was of course, well known, and guilt was held to be his alone. Even though justice prevailed, Chapiro was disgruntled and left without drinking. This in itself would be sufficient to mark him as a deviant, for Basurco's observations are still very much applicable. In marked contrast to many Cayapa men, Chapiro has always been more interested in sexual pursuits than in drinking and the married men in the area were beginning to view him as a real threat. In instances like this it is felt that the best way to remove the threat is to marry him off, forcibly, if need be. In the case of Chapiro events came to a head after he had seduced Gabriel's daughter. The lack of interest on the part of the young woman, coupled with Chapiro's poor reputation, apparently led Gabriel to make it clear to Chapiro that he did not want him as a son-in-law. A year or two later, the /ún yi/, Arcilio, died and Gabriel became the chief. Gabriel now began to consider Chapiro's threat to his daughter, who was now married. He ordered Lorenzo Añapa and Aurelio Añapa, two of the /čá itala/, to go up to Sapallo Grande during Christmas and to bring back a wife for Chapiro. They found a woman who was lame and not very eagerly sought after as a marriage partner, inasmuch as she could not work effectively in the monte. They brought her to Chapiro's house and presented her to him. He refused to take her, but Lorenzo said that if he did not take the girl, he would beat him. Chapiro then agreed to [Page 136] marry her. In 1960 he seemed happy with his wife, especially since she gave birth to a boy, and since his marriage he apparently has stayed close to home. It may be that the choice of a crippled wife for Chapiro was deliberate and with malice afore-thought. Chapiro's reputation, however, extended beyond the sexual sphere, and he was known to be lazy and a poor worker. Most women would have refused him as a husband anyway. What is important, however, is the fact that the solution worked, and that Chapiro was effectively removed from circulation. It should be mentioned for the record that when he was queried about Chapiro's wife, Lorenzo Añapa reported, with what appeared to the writer to be no small measure of satisfaction, “She can't work very well in the fields because of her bad leg.”",NA,NA,NA,MALE,MALE,NA,NA,MALE,NA,MALE,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,f1322a6d99,sd06-004,sd06

The following allusion is repeated again and again, almost word for word: “People will commend you and say you are a good human being!” Indeed, the sense of honor is highly developed among our Yamana. Anyone who touches them here strikes their most sensitive point. Hence everyone makes a serious effort to acquire a good reputation and undoubtedly performs some good deed only in order to be thought of as honorable and blameless. Many a person will make a considerable sacrifice, remain silent during a verbal battle between others, forgo eating in spite of hunger, give away a valuable object, perform work for an aged man whom he dislikes very much, and do many other things merely so that he will be generally regarded as a paragon. To be the object of sad reproaches would humiliate any one of them to such an extent that he would avoid contact with those who knew about it perhaps for a period of years and even live alone in obscure retreats. There is a danger here that the conduct of the individual may turn to duplicity and hypocrisy. The way of life, however, counteracts this effectively, for neither falsehood nor deceit can permanently hide behind its simplicity and transparency. The Yamana without exception believe in the ability of their medicine men and are convinced of their power. This faith is most clearly demonstrated by everyone's attitude of awe and genuine fear toward the yékamuš, by the trust the individual shows when he approaches the yékamuš with his requests, and finally by the confidence with which the general public expects help from him for major and minor needs. In his extreme helplessness, many a Yamana has only the medicine man as a last resource. It is true that the people recognize greater or lesser ability in their yékamuš and they probably also deprecate the good reputation of one or another of them, making him out to be weak and incapable. Nevertheless everyone fears them, and a person must expect their revenge if they hear of his expressing disdainful opinions of them. Bridges repeatedly begged the Yamana: “Do not believe what your yékamuš say and do, for their deeds and their behavior are crafty deceptions! Do not believe the cunningly calculated nonsense that they use to trick you!” As a matter of fact, he expressed himself so scornfully [Page 1304] 1387 cont. about their effectiveness that it was bound to shock everyone, especially the medicine men. After biding their time, two of the insulted yékamuš decided to avenge the slander cast upon their calling, and said: “We shall have our revenge! Perhaps we shall succeed in inflicting real harm on that European! The character formation just described is fostered by the many principles that are followed in training the young in the parental hut (p. 704). No less beneficial for adults is the pressure for many kinds of social duties (p. 905). Morality in the widest sense of the term is held in universal esteem (p. 1022); the majority of tribal members try to fulfill their duty faithfully. Even Bridges (e):333 did not suppress the following acknowledgment: “Among the Yahgan, vices of all kinds were condemned on account of their evil consequences, while virtue, because of its good results, was recommended.” Once again it is to be admitted that many a Fuegian stays on the proper path, especially in the realm of sexual morality, primarily because he wishes to retain his good reputation among his neighbors. The feeling for proper modesty, more among women than men , and for justice in general is well developed; the form and content of Fuegian rules of etiquette are surprising. Bridges later corrected many of his false assertions when he confessed: “The native mind is much more settled in approval of what is good and against evil than ever I have known before, and they are consequently better behaved, and exercise more self-control” /cited in English/ (MM:XVIII, 31, 1884).

"Heald, Suzette 1989 “Controlling Anger: The Sociology Of Gisu Violence” International African Library Manchester [England]: Manchester University Press, for the International African Institute, London ; Distributed in the USA and Canada by St Martin’s Press https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=fk13-003","They are all crucially concerned with the triad kamani, buwangafu and lirima. Kamani refers primarily to physical strength. Buwangafu, on the other hand, implies ‘toughness’. However, since the Gisu do not rigidly distinguish between qualities of mind and qualities of body, kamani is used with the wider meaning of a ‘strong man’ and buwangafu implies toughness of mind as much as of body, singleness of purpose as much as physical strength. Deriving from the verb xuwangala, it combines the connotations of ageing and bravery. Thus one set of meanings relate directly to the fact of age, being translatable according to context as ‘to come of age’, ‘to last long’, ‘to survive’, to ‘endure’. The other connotations make this a masculine rather than a feminine quality, with the ability to endure identified with courage, boldness and bravery. Thus the term umuwangafu may be used to describe an old and worthy or, alternatively, a man with a reputation for bravery. Used as a form of address it is the praise term par excellence. Yet male power of this kind rests ultimately on [Page 60] lirima, the power of men that allows for forceful and determined action. Buwangafu thus cannot escape some of the negative connotations that go with lirima. The things which last long, that are toughest, are also the most dangerous to others, just as the most bitter medicines are the most potent.        Violence in such situations is thus not only likely to meet with implacable opposition from the father, but the son's reputation also suffers with outsiders, as he becomes known as a man who cannot keep his temper and who will resort to extreme means to achieve his ends. This is effectively a no-win situation. A man may be tempted to step up a dispute by flouting the avoidance and respect rules, or by a direct resort to violence, in order to get outsiders involved in any dispute he might have with his father over land. But such action rarely operates to his advantage. Wepuxulu's position certainly worsened considerably as a result of forcing the issue over the land, since he not only lost outright any claims to it but in addition was forced to migrate. This, in turn, was interpreted to his detriment, confirming an impression that he was footloose and unlikely ever to farm his lands successfully. Taken together such behaviour may act as an effective disqualifier, for no man is obliged to allocate resources to a wastrel. Thus, it is not just violence in the familial setting which is at issue in such cases, for bad relationships here may have repercussions that get the individual a bad reputation with others. And this is crucial to understanding patterns of accusation and killing; what might begin between father and son is taken further elsewhere and both may rebound on the individual's life chances in a literal way. In losing his patrimony a man also risks losing his character. The association of troublemaking with bachelors was briefly indicated in the last chapter. The nature of the judgements involved here may now be discussed further To be a bachelor is necessarily to be deviant in Gisu terms, a challenge to what the Gisu regard as not only the ideal but the only state of manhood. Failure to gain or to keep a wife is often taken as symptomatic that the individual concerned is spoilt, unable to set his mind to the normal pursuits of adulthood and likely instead to be a wastrel. The Gisu proverb, ‘The thing which is spoilt goes on spoiling itself’, is indeed prophetic when applied to the fate of many bachelors and underlines the reaction to them. Outside, and indeed adrift from, the mainstream of society not only are they penalised in the normal processes of accumulation but every action they take to press their cause and advance their interests may be interpreted, as has been seen, to their [Page 116] detriment. It can now be noted, with reference to the homicide survey, that the longer a man remains unmarried the less likely he is ever to marry. 	    Of the 73% of the men in this survey who were married within eight years of being circumcised, 95% were still married (though not necessarily to the same wife) at the time of the survey. In contrast, of the 27% of men who had not managed to marry within eight years of their circumcision only 46.5% had managed to marry thereafter. This distribution is due not only to the lack of Table 14 The effects of wifelessness on eventual marriage chances
Percentage married at the time of survey Percentage of reference group married within eight years of circumcision 73 95 Percentage of reference group not married within eight years of circumcision 27 46.5

The men of the reference group included for the purposes of this table were those aged thirty and above, a total of 127.initial bridewealth but to the reputation that such men gain which then prejudices their chances of ever gaining bridewealth, just as it deters any woman from choosing them for a husband. A woman's grinding song serves notice of the attitude here: The man who does not dig, look, how he quarrels with you The man who has no job, look, he eats like an ass The man with a job, look, he eats only enough.   Cursing with its power to destroy a man's heart and motivation provides a plausible explanation for the fate of many unfortunate young men, even if it does not in turn exonerate them. By 1969 Deo was as ill-liked as his father, although for different reasons. And here one might enquire further into the question of plausibility. In Mutsonga's case one may adduce several factors. In the first place he already had a reputation for violence. He had killed a thief in 1961 and while this act was considered justified — he received a nominal sentence of one day — violence of any kind is often in speech likened to witchcraft, being termed bulosi, both being emanations of the same emotion, lirima. Violence and witchcraft are straight alternatives. Added to this, he was [Page 126] also renowned for his knowledge of ritual matters (see further, case 11). Given this background, cursing his son in anger could indeed be seen as an understandable response. Nor at first, while he still had a well-paid job and a woman to keep house for him, did Deo's reputation suffer to the extent that he was defined as a ‘danger’ to others. Only when Deo lost his wives and then his job did people begin to comment unfavourably on his drunkenness.",NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,MALE,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,769724c146,fk13-003,fk13

The Uru Chiefs are Masai by origin. The first ancestor, Aden, had four sons of whom one, Mkuruo, settled on the Rau River. Here a portion of his following separated and migrated to the country West of Arusha. Mkuruo remained, and being rich in stock, bartered meat for honey with the Clans Kimaro and Wakimaha. Later these clans invited him to settle among them, and offered their services in return for gifts of meat and milk, of which they had none. Mkuruo agreed and moved to Ngangafumo, close to Moshi town, where the Uru Chiefs still sacrifice to their ancestors. Afterwards he moved to where the Chiefs now reside in Uru. At first the people tilled his fields and built huts for him, in short served him as a Chief is served, for the sake of meat. His reputation greatly increased when he gave to each family one cow, and so earned their devotion. It seems, however, that a certain section mistrusted Mkuruo's growing power and conspired against him. They had, however, no weapons, while Mkuruo was possessed of arms. It may be mentioned that Mkuruo's arms were kept as family heirlooms by the Uru Chiefs down to the time of the German rule, when they were taken to Germany as exhibits and never returned. Of those defeated by Mkuruo, it is related that they fled and settled North West of Mount Meru, where they remain to this day, and are known under the name of Sonjo. This story is somewhat remarkable; the Sonjo natives are a curious and obscure people, said to be of Bantu-Hamitic race, and little known to Europeans.",NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,98d41e4cde,fn04-004,fn04

The first type is stigmatized as a “slut” (omokayayu) because she has achieved a reputation for promiscuity. This type of girl engages in [Page 979] intercourse with men and boys she knows very slightly, and after relatively little persuasion. With her, resistance in coitus is probably conscious role-playing designed to please her lover. Some girls of this type occasionally take on a number of young men in succession. Although she is in demand as a sexual partner, a girl with this sort of reputation is considered highly undesirable as a wife and is ordinarily not married with bridewealth unless her marriage takes place at an early age before her reputation has spread. She is likely to elope from the home of her father or legitimate husband and live as the concubine of one man after another. The second, and probably modal, type is that of the girl with real ambivalence about engaging in premarital intercourse. She desires it but is careful not to be taken advantage of. Thus she will not meet privately with a boy until after he has bestowed numerous gifts upon her from the market; these may be head scarves, bananas, and candy. She rejects the advances of some boys whom she finds unattractive. Her accessibility for sexual liaisons also depends on her moods and the skill of her would-be seducer. Sometimes she is unapproachable; on other occasions, such as a marriage dance, her resistance may be easily broken down, especially by a dashing young man who serenades her on the guitar. She engages in provocative behavior, mostly of a hostile sort such as sexual joking, but is determined not to be publicly compromised and not to give away her sexual favors until she has received tangible rewards and flattering attention from her prospective lover. With her, resistance in coitus is partly conscious role-playing and partly an expression of real fears and hostility. This type of girl, if her sexual activity is not discovered and does not result in premarital pregnancy, is considered desirable as a wife, for the marriage intermediary (esigani) will have no scandal to report to the groom. The prospective husband and his family do not want the intermediary to pry so deeply into the girl's affairs that he reports her casual liaisons; if she has been discreet enough not to acquire a reputation as a “slut,” then he ordinarily informs them that she is chaste. There is no inspection of the hymen, for the husband does not desire knowledge of his wife's premarital experience so long as she is considered a proper girl. The third type of Gusii girl is the one in whom sex anxiety and hostility toward men outweigh heterosexual desires. Such a girl may acquire a reputation for rejecting sexual advances and eventually be avoided by boys in the marketplace, though her desirability as a wife is in no way diminished. Ordinarily, a girl of this type continues going to the market with the other girls and meets numerous boys who know neither her nor her reputation. Despite her fear of sexuality she enjoys the gifts, the flattery, the attention from the boys, and thus tends to exploit her suitors without giving them the sexual satisfaction they desire in exchange. Though she may even refuse sexual overtures at wedding dances and scold the young men who make them, it appears that most girls of this type do occasionally have intercourse before marriage. When they do, their resistance and crying is probably commensurate with their real feelings, and they are more likely to cover their faces during coitus and be [Page 980] overcome with remorse afterwards. It seems likely, though I have no definite evidence on this point, that such girls become the difficult wives who restrict marital sexual activity and who quarrel over it with their husbands.",NA,NA,NA,FEMALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FEMALE,FEMALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,d0f07504dc,fl08-025,fl08

The group so defined consists of neighbours who generally look for arbitration and advice to one particular elder among them who has a special reputation for ‘wisdom’. In former days these units appear to have fluctuated and re-formed around the personalities of distinguished elders. To-day, having been recognized and encouraged by the Administration, they have fixed territorial boundaries—often corresponding to those of from one to three ‘large risaga’ areas—within which every homestead may resort to the local elder, regardless of lineage allegiance. But while the demarcation of the etureti districts is thus purely territorial, it will often be found that in practice the selection of the elders is made on a lineage basis: examples of this will be given when we come to discuss the present-day political significance of the lineage principle",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,57b6b7b2d8,fl08-001,fl08

Sex and age are two, more general, conditioning attributes of local influence. Women and children have always a position inferior to that of men. Women occasionally gain a reputation as prophets and magicians but, as a rule, they play no leading part in public affairs. Among the Nuer, relations between the sexes, and between man and wife, are more equitable and give females more privilege than in any other tribe I have visited in the Southern Sudan. Nevertheless, they are subject to men: daughters to their fathers and wives to their husbands. Boys are under the command of their parents and elder brothers and only become full tribesmen, with the privileges and responsibilities of such, at initiation. The relations between the sexes and between children and adults belong rather to an account of domestic relations than to a study of political institutions. Age by itself does not give a man social position. He must have other qualifications as well. Those elders with most influence are the gaat twot, the children of bulls. Such a man is called a tut, bull, and in strict usage this is equivalent to dil, tribal aristocrat. As will be fully explained in Chapter V a dil is a member of the dominant clan in each tribe and, in virtue of his membership, has within that tribe a slightly superior social position. This clan is not a ruling class and the enhanced prestige of its members is very indefinite. The clan system has no hereditary leadership; a senior lineage does not rank higher than others; there is no ‘father of the clan’; and there is no ‘council of clan elders’. Tut is also used in a wider sense to refer to men of social position who do not belong to the dominant clan but to other lineages which have long been domiciled in the tribe. A tut in this rather wide sense of ‘man of good standing’, or ‘social leader’, is usually a scion of an important lineage, the head of his own family, and master of his homestead and herd. He is generally also the eldest surviving son of his father's family and, therefore, head also of the joint family, the master of the hamlet. If he is to gain a social reputation he must also possess sufficient cows to be able to entertain guests and to attract young kinsmen to reside in his byre. Round such a man's homestead are clustered the homesteads of his brothers and married sons and, often enough, the homesteads of his sisters' husbands and daughters' husbands. To be a social leader, whose opinion is readily agreed to, he must also be a man of character and ability. In larger groups than a village and camp there is far less [Page 181] co-ordination of activities and less scope for leadership. Only in war is there any lengthy direct co-operation. Men noted for their prowess and ability stir up among the youths enthusiasm for a raid against the Dinka or a fight against another tribal section, and direct what simple tactics are employed, but these men have no political status or permanent leadership. The warriors mobilize in local divisions of their own accord, for there are no regiments and companies under officers, and in fighting they follow the most forward and courageous among them. Some of these warriors become renowned and their reputation quickly attracts recruits for raids. Two of the most famous war leaders were Latjor who led the Jikany tribes, and Bidiit who led the Lou, eastwards. Neither had any ritual qualifications, but both were men of outstanding ability who were members of the dominant clans of their tribes. It is not said by Nuer that either established any political control, or even had great authority, in their tribes. The role of prophets in war is examined later.

He has no executive powers with political force behind them, although it is expected that he will attempt to intervene in the early stages of a feud, and he sometimes threatens to use his power to curse the disputants if they will not agree. Moreover, in all matters in dispute, the frequency with which he will be approached depends largely on his prestige and personality, and not merely on his hereditary status. Other persons with no hereditary ritual status might easily acquire a reputation for fairness and tact and be employed as arbitrators in minor disputes.

A community leader was, first and foremost, someone who “helps others to eat” by freely extending hospitality to all and sundry while simultaneously restricting his reliance on the hospitality of others. “A greedy man” (raam me daar/cueer mithä), in contrast, “soon finds himself sitting alone.” Moreover, several men and women remarked that “the best way” to criticize the character or behavior of a close relative was to accuse him or her of avarice in matters of food. Whereas charges of, say, cowardice, debauchery, or thievery would inevitably reflect back upon the family's reputation as a whole, every adult man and woman was seen to be personally responsible for his or her eating habits. Nevertheless, rural Nuer constituencies were not in themselves adverse to the election of highly educated chiefs. During the early 1980s the western Nuer boasted two high-ranking government chiefs who had acquired basic literacy skills in English. However, these chiefs were exceptional in that they had acquired their educations locally and had continued to live and work in their rural homelands. For instance, the highly respected head chief of the western Bul Nuer, Luk Gatluak, had acquired his literacy skills [Page 281] in Bentiu. Upon graduation he served as court scribe for many years before being elected as a government chief. During these years he gradually acquired a reputation for defending the rights of ordinary villagers in their confrontations with the regional administration. Consequently, he won his post in an electoral landslide—even though he himself was never scarified What villagers resisted were the election bids of urbanized Nuer who were not fully engaged with rural community life.",NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,a041971439,fj22-018,fj22

Such persistent [Page 107]FIG. 2.

Diagram of Ngundeng's Mound (not to scale)[Page 108]FIG. 4. Ngundeng's batonrequests gave the prophet a reputation for greediness, and his dayiemni were often suspected of using the prophet's requests to collect cattle on their own behalf. Not surprisingly Ngundeng's demands were sometimes refused. Ngundeng sang bitterly of such rejection, and he reminded those who would refuse him of the symbols and proofs of his spiritual strength: the ox jokpading who was sacrificed at the battle of Pading, his ox-name kur, the leopard-skins which were the symbols of the master's office, and his baton (Fig. 4), the curved stick with which he killed so many persons at Pading that the vultures came swooping down. Ngundeng's success may have been only partial, but it was cumulative. He began preaching (through his songs) before the Dinka threat of the late 1870s. He received only mildly favourable attention until he proved himself at Pading. His successful response to that challenge attracted more followers, but he maintained and expanded his following through the persuasiveness of his propaganda, the apparent efficacy of his blessings, and his manipulation of the networks of redistribution and generosity that he was able to create. By the time of the rinderpest epidemic of 1888–9 he had already articulated a philosophy of social harmony and had gained a considerable spiritual reputation. His actions in meeting the smallpox and rinderpest which swept in from Ethiopia may, or may not, have limited the effects of those two epidemics; but he gained the credit for having done so, and used that credit to mobilize labour on a large scale to build his Mound. The idea to build such a Mound pre-dated rinderpest; the willingness of the general population to build the Mound followed Ngundeng's response to the disease. People were persuaded to work on the Mound as a form of protection against future epidemics; once it was built it became a focus of religious and social attention which helped attract more persons to Ngundeng, thereby spreading his message further. Ngundeng did respond to a series of immediate crises. His perceived success in meeting these challenges enhanced his reputation; each success increased the popular willingness to accept his general message, thus improving his ability effectively to address challenges endemic to the Nuer community. One of Pok's close companions was his father's brother's son Lam Liew Dieu. Liew Dieu had also been a singer for Ngundeng and a composer in his own right. Lam was still a boy when the Anuak raided and narrowly escaped capture. As a young man he earned a reputation both for singing and for bravery. He helped Pok organize all his raids and also led the singing at prayer-meetings. Because of his ancestral link with Deng Laka he also became a close friend of Dual Diu, who shared with him the Ngok Dinka clan-divinity WIU. Lam reinforced Pok's link with the Gaawar and was probably an intermediary between Pok and Dual. Lam also sang Ngundeng songs at Dual's prayer-meetings. Car was well known for praying for rain, and he was also known as the prophet of a divinity which disliked fighting. It is clear from contemporary sources that Car had no reputation as a raider. He had only a moderate herd of cattle, built up entirely from bridewealth payments and gifts from supplicants. Whether he was approached and refused or was never asked, Car and the Maiker kept out of the 1916 raid and avoided confrontation with the army in 1917. Pok's appeal before 1916 was limited to the Gun Lou; certainly the Mor did not come to him with their problems. But the story of Pok's resurrection of his son may be evidence of a flamboyant style of self-publicity which could have encouraged the Lou to seek his services. This is indicated in the contemporary report, but surely the most telling factor in his favour was [Page 173] his willingness to raid the Dinka. He increased both his prestige and his herd as a resul Being a member of the Kerpeil section Cany was a potential earth-master, but he does not seem to have been as renowned an earth-master as Mayom Kuai and Dag Mer, two other members of his lineage who were his contemporaries. In fact, Cany Reth was best known as a magician (guan wal), practising magic openly after Deng Laka's death. He gained a reputation for controlling rain, amassed a large herd of cattle, and was feared within the Radh section, for his magic was known to kill. Such a powerful magician among the Radh was a direct challenge to the authority of a prophet among the Bar. But added to Cany's challenge to Dual was his seniority, his membership of the earth-master family Dual's father had displaced, and his close alliance with the government as a literate (and therefore administratively useful) ex-soldier. The divinity TENY was quiet after Kolang Ket's successful confrontation with Puot Nyuon. Puot had belonged to the Tigjiek section of Dok, and in about 1919–20 TENY reappeared in Buom Diu, a man from the Dogwar section, unrelated to Puot. Buom came from an ‘aristocrat’ family but, being neither an earth-master nor a man of cattle, he had no hereditary association with divinity. His mother had been captured by slavers in the nineteenth century but had managed to escape and return to her people, where she married and subsequently had two daughters and Buom, her only son. As a young man Buom was relatively prosperous, since his sisters were married before him and there were no full brothers to contend for shares in the bridewealth. Buom is remembered as having a sizeable herd prior to his seizure. As an adult he was renowned as a warrior against the Dinka and as a quarrelsome man among his own people around Ler, where he also gained a reputation for seducing other men's wives. In distinct contrast to the characters of some eastern prophets, such as Ngundeng and Dual Diu, he seemed an unlikely candidate for seizure by a divinity.",MALE,MALE,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,MALE,MALE,MALE,NA,NA,MALE,MALE,6152e5e0cd,fj22-017,fj22

Although war is now ended, there are still former war-leaders who remain prominent men. War-leadership is also a kind of training in influencing men, making decisions, etc. Reputation as a warrior is also important. Foretelling the future (‘akilamlam’) is done by throwing the sandals, interpreting the entrails of a goat or ox, or, with the highest grade of diviner, by direct information from Akuj. To throw sandals, any pair can be used. They are placed soles together, twirled into the air with a jerk of the wrist and allowed to fall onto the ground. The pattern they form on the ground can be interpreted taking into account which side up each falls, how (if at all) one lies on another, and in what direction each lies. Any man can do this, but certain lay-men are acknowledged to be especially skilled. Unless the matter is of some importance a proper diviner will not be consulted — for he will charge a fee of a goat or two. A group of men will sometimes throw sandals to determine the whereabouts of stray animals, the likelihood of rain, the direction of potential movements, and so on. Sometimes it is performed more or less as a diversion over quite trivial affairs, and the sandals will be thrown many times (ten or twenty times) until a satisfactory result is obtained. Not every man agrees on the interpretation of the result of each throw and pleasant argument ensues. I have seen this done where a few donkeys had strayed, and where the arrival of an expected visitor was discussed. But there are occasions when sandal-throwing is more serious — when it will directly affect decisions about migrations and weather expectations, and most importantly concerning raiding. I am told that in the old days certain lay-men earned a wide reputation forecasting the success of raids, determining auspicious occasions on which to set out and so on. Ekal (whose authobiography is given in Appendix 8) is reputed to have relied to a great extent on his sandal-throwing when leading raids. But there are apparently professional specialists — diviners — who have great skill in sandal throwing, and will also interpret the entrails of a goat or ox slaughtered for the occasion. Such men have a mystical power from Akuj which allows them their abilities. They will also use these powers to foretell the type of treatment for sick people or any other occasion when they are consulted by individuals.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,11532128df,fl17-009,fl17

I had failed to anticipate that people as conservative as the Bedouins, for whom belonging to tribe and family are paramount and the education of girls novel, would assume that a woman alone must have so alienated her family, especially her male kin, that they no longer cared about her. Worse yet, perhaps she had done something so immoral that they had ostracized her.

By accompanying me, my father hoped to lay any such suspicions to rest. Perhaps even more important for consolidating social and political power has been the gradual expansion of the types of resources that can be privately owned, which has enabled some people to make others dependent and thus to control them. Whereas formerly, economic, political, and social status were not tied—as status and leadership were based largely on genealogy and achieved reputation, and dependency implied less economic helplessness—today they are becoming increasingly coterminous. It should be clear from this digression into the expectations regarding women’s conformity to the cultural ideals that dependents, including women, strive for honor in the traditional sense. They share with their providers the same ideals for self-image and social reputation, which they try to follow in their everyday lives. Yet the situations in which they can realize these ideals, in particular those of independence and assertiveness, are circumscribed.

"Mohsen, Safia K 1974 “Quest For Order Among Awlad Ali Of The Western Desert Of Egypt” Ann Arbor, Michigan: University Microfilms https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=mt09-002","The Amar paper of the Aggary explicitly states some of the basic characteristics of the Amar as a unit in the tribal organization of Awlad Ali. The most distinctive aspect of the Eila or the Amar as a political unit is the absence of any formalized leadership. Although the Amar is viewed by outsiders as a corporate group as far as its legal responsibility in certain cases, from the standpoint of its members, the Amar is no more than the sum total of its constiuent units or Baits. This is shown in the Amar paper of Aggary which states that matters affecting the Amar be decided upon by all the bait represented by their respective leaders, the awaqil. There is no formalized authority above the awaqil, although one of the awaqil might acquire a position of informal leadership by virtue of personal or other qualities. He will be considered as a mediator and go-between for the various leaders of the Baits. In the case of the Aggary, Sheihk Selouma, the Aqila of Bait Eweida, has acquired such a leadership among the Eilat Aggary. Although Shiehk Selouma is relatively young, (he is about 40 years old), he has the reputation of getting things done. His Bait is the wealthiest in the [Page 54] Aggary and he himself has recently acquired a great amount of wealth, mostly from smuggling goods across the Libyan borders. Because of his position as a Government Sheihk, he is believed to have influencial connections in the government. He is the only member of the Aggary Amar who has a car. He considers himself to be the spokesman of the Aggary Family, and he is known to be able to persuade the reluctant awaqil to conform to decisions made by the rest of the awaqil. In a number of instances he was able to collect bloodmoney from members of the Amar who had previously refused to pay. Some people in the area believe that had it not been for the persuasive abilities of Sheihk Selouma, the Aggary Amar could never have persisted, and it would have long ago been divided into smaller units due to the lack of agreement among its members. The lack of formalized leadership of the Amar or the Eila makes consensus of extreme importance for the Amar. The emphasis on the unity of the Amar is stated in Article 2 and is implied in a number of other articles in the Amar paper of Aggary. Disagreement among the awaqil is very rare although not unknown in the area. The relative consensus among the awaqil stems from the fact that the Amar as a group has a fairly limited function. Until very recently the only practical function of the Amar was the collection of money to pay for a murder committed by one of its members. Since establishing the innocence or guilt of the accused is not the duty of the Amar, once his guilt has been established, there is no question about the payment. Disagreements are likely to occur in the case of new circumstances where money has to be paid, since payment in such cases are not yet institutionalized, even when specified in a given Amar paper. This has not yet become a major problem. If any disagreement between the [Page 55] responsibility of the majority of the awaqil to persuade the minority to conform to the majority’s decision. This is usually done by simple personal persuasion. In certain instances, however, when a particular aqila is known for being troublesome to the Amar, refusing to abide by the majority decisions, an attempt may be made by the others to build up popular support around another person in the Bait which the aqila represents. If this strategy is successful, it might lead to replacing the aqila by another who is more abiding to the Amar’s decisions. This approach is more likely to succeed if the aqila is not a popular person in his own Bait, for if he is popular, any attempt by the other Baits to disqualify the aqila would be viewed by the members of his Bait as interference in their own affairs and might lead them to rally even more strongly around their leader. The above is the summary of events that happened before I came to the area, and which were told to me by informants including the parties involved. Since most of these events occurred more than ten years ago, [Page 70] it was impossible to verify the actual facts or to know what exactly happened. But since the parties involved are still alive and since these events are closely related to present-day happenings, the case is still alive in the minds of the parties involved as well as those of outsiders-Naturlaly, each party tries to present the facts in such a way as to support his own claims. Shei’eb, for example, insists that Hakim had bribed members of bait Asabei’ to refuse to pay their share in order to embarrass him and make him appear as unable to perform his duties as Aqila. “Hakim always had his eyes on becoming the Aqila of bait Asabei’,” said Shei’eb, “but he had no business becoming the Aqila, so he had to make me look bad to the other Awaqil.... He likes to be looked up to as a big man, but it wouldn’t work.” While other members of bait Asabei’ deny that Hakim had bribed them, they agree with Shei’eb that Hakim is a dishonest man. In fact, Hakim’s reputation is so widespread in the area that it has earned him the nickname of “the thief”. The nickname was given to him a few years ago when he went to Mecca for a pilgrimage with another fellow tribesman. The latter told the story that while in Mecca Hakim had found a purse with two hundred pounds in it. He was supposed to return the purse to the authorities or it would be considered as stealing if he kept it. Stealing in Mecca is not only a crime but also a great sin which makes the holy trip void for the offender. Hakim told his companion that he had given the purse to the authorities. But later, on their way back from Mecca, the friend found the purse hidden in Hakim’s luggage. When the story was known in the area, he was referred to as “the thief”. Other accounts of Hakim’s dishonesty are told throughout the area, including stories of how he acquired his wealth through stealing [Page 71] equipment from the government projects and from smuggling sheep and merchandise across the Libyan border. Although some of these stories might be exaggerated, they all point to the fact that Hakim, despite his wealth, is not the most popular or reputable individual in bait Asabei’, and that although Shei’eb is not a popular individual either, he definitely comes up the winner in any popularity contest between the two. The question is why Hakim was selected by the Awaqil to replace Shei’eb. The case involved more than Shei’eb’s inability to collect the money from members of his bait. Shei’eb’s ineffectiveness seemed to have been taken as an excuse rather than as the direct cause. Many Aqaqil, before Shei’eb, had failed in collecting money from their own bait without being subject to direct challenge. What seems to be involved is more than a challenge to a particular member, Shei’eb. It is a challenge to the whole principle by which Shei’eb acquired his position as Aqila of bait Asabei’: patrilineal succession. The importance of patrilineal succession as the basis of the Aqila’s authority may be better understood by contrasting it to a closely related position, that of the “mardi”. A man within a bait may acquire, by virtue of personal qualities, a reputation for wisdom and soundness of opinion which may overshadow that of the Aqila. Such a person becomes known throughout a certain area as a successful mediator and go-between; and therefore is called upon to solve disputes not limited to members of his own bait. He thus acquires an informal position which cuts across a number of baits and sometimes larger political units. Although women among Awlad Ali are not given the same legal right of divorcing the husband by pronouncing the “dismissal formula,” they are given the right of certain customary procedures which in practice give them equal facilities for dissolving the marriage. This is known as the right of the woman to “throw herself.” This means that the woman takes all her clothes and sometimes her children and goes to the dwelling of [Page 139] the man she chooses. She informs him before she enters his house that she is the wife of so and so and the daughter of so and so and that she is throwing herself on him to protect her from her husband with whom she no longer wishes to live. Like the right of refuge, the man cannot refuse to let her in; and from this moment until her dispute with her husband is resolved, she is considered as his house guest and is entitled to all the hospitality a guest receives. If he refuses to extend that hospitality or refuses to take her in, she can ask for a mi’ad and is entitled to kabara from him. There has been no reported incidents in which a man refused that right to a woman. As soon as she settles down in the host’s house, the latter takes immediate measures to find the husband and to convince him to let his wife go. In doing this, the man uses all the power of persuasion. The man selected for this purpose is usually a respected man who can put pressure upon the husband. Sometimes he has to bribe the husband to release the wife, paying from his own money. The man has to have money, not only to be able to support the wife during her stay in his house and to bribe the husband, but also because in certain instances he has to pay the husband the mahr that the father of the wife had taken in order to free her. The next step after getting the agreement of the husband to divorce his wife is to contact the father of the wife or her guardian and convince him to pay the mahr to the husband. If the father does not agree, or if he is financially unable to do so, the man on whom the woman has thrown herself is supposed to pay from his own money. In cases where the woman left the husband to be married to another man with whom she had had a relationship, the respected man tries to have the future husband pay the present husband the mahr he is supposed to pay the woman after she is divorced from her [Page 140] husband. In a number of cases the husband was willing to divorce the woman after a promise by the man that she would pay him the mahr when she got married. In most cases, however, the process costs the man a considerable amount of money. Sometimes, when the woman is young and attractive, the man finds it to his advantage to keep her as his wife, since she will cost him no more expenses. On the other hand, the man cannot refuse a woman the right of refuge, since to do this or to deny her the right of hospitality will make him liable to pay kabara if she made the refusal known publicly. On the other hand, it is prestigious to be known in the area as a man to whom women go to be released from their husbands. In fact, a man who acquires a reputation of getting wives released is likely to be sought as mardi in other cases as well.",NA,MALE,MALE,MALE,MALE,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,MALE,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,615de53b2e,mt09-002,mt09

Furthermore, many urban traditional healers receive fees for herbs that they recommend to their patients instead of waiting to collect the fees after a cure has been effected and the client's family is satisfied. In the rural areas most traditiona healers continue to follow the normal practice of not receiving the fees until the patient is fully cured. On the other hand, rural villages are inhabited by people who are known to each other. Thus there is no real need for a healer to publicize his practice. His reputation depends on the success of his treatments which are generally known in the area.

Anyone who is morose, jealous, greedy or quarrelsome is linked with evil and therefore, as the child develops, he is regaled with a horrible picture of the witch and continually warned to follow a normal course in life and to avoid doing anything which might harm his reputation. He must always control his temper and never use threatening language, or take anything that does not belong to [Page 16] him or tell a lie. Indeed he must go to any lengths never to give any reason for others to point a finger at him. When food is eaten or beer drunk, it is always taken from a common pot. But besides producing a well-mannered and good member of society this philosophy teaches every person to remember that anyone who is more fortunate than his fellow men is liable to excite the envy of a witch and thus the rich and the more successful in life are likely to be struck down by these evil people. Perhaps African business men fail to succeed because of this inward fear of the consequences of accumulating much wealth. Success in business or any achievement which brings a man to the notice of the public may arouse jealousy and cause him to be struck down by a witch. It is obvious that such fears tend to resist change and progress in the modern sense. Change is not welcomed but conformity encouraged. But this is not the only force which produces conformity and a longing for normality instead of brilliance. I have tried to show that the African's religion is another factor in this process, as it emphasizes the importance of living the same life as that of the departed grandparents. What was good enough for them is considered good enough for their descendants. The ancestral spirits do not want their children to leave their villages or seek the cities where they are taught bad habits and where they meet strange men with dangerous characters. I have often met African patients who attributed their illnesses to the displeasure of these spirits, because they have forsaken their villages and gone to live in the town. Frequently these fears force them to return to their ancestral homes and take up the same sort of life enjoyed by their much-loved departed parents. I am not sure which of the two influences — the belief in evil forces or the love of the religion and the dead ancestors — is more responsible for the conformity of the African with his resistance to change and his search for normality. I personally favour the religious factor. His religious beliefs are very deeply ingrained and their influence and that of his father has tended to be overlooked and those of witchcraft overstressed. Despite the fact that the belief in witchcraft was widely accepted in Europe, even during the period of the Renaissance, progress took place. This of course may have been due to the new look which Christianity assumed which made it a moving force. I came across the following passage in the journal of the Rev. F. W. Sykes written in 1887–8; it illustrates his impression of how very [Page 17] essential it was for the Matabele to conform to what was regarded as normal among them:‘At Hope Fountain the congregation numbered between 25 or 30 men and women — no children attended — and I was surprised at their attention, perfectly still. The boys and girls just came in as they were, naked, only having an apology for a covering round their loins. The boys and men always carry their sticks and assegais wherever they go. No native is allowed to sit on a stool in their own houses or church, or are they allowed to use anything European such as cups, knives and forks, plates, jugs, tables, and they are afraid to make anything in the shape of bread, scones or to follow any good example of the white man, for fear of being punished and bewitching anybody. There have been cases of men evincing a desire to learn and know more of the Bible and some could or can read very nicely, but there is only one case which I know of where a boy would take and has taken his stand for the gospel.’ A person with hunhu must never be harsh to young or old, and when he is at a beer party he must conduct himself quietly and with dignity, be pleasant and share a laugh with others. A man who has built up a good reputation because of his hunhu finds that other families are eager for their daughters to marry his sons. On the other hand if it should become known that the character of a man or the reputation of the family is bad everyone will be told to avoid them. More precious than anything to the African is a good personality ( hunhu).",NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,da57b039b5,fs05-013,fs05

Everyone knows whether a powerful man like Cuulu has medicines or not, and their possession is a substantial, even feared sanction for his actions. A successful man necessarily has medicines and medicines breed success both for their possessor and, possibly, for his followers. A choice patron also controls desirable land he has managed to obtain through clearing or inheritance and which he can use to bind others to him. On [Page 146] this land the successful man also has wives who represent labour and wealth. Wives brew beer which can be converted into cash, work and more wealth; their daughters may provide elopement and marriage wealth in addition. Through affinity and procreation wives provide valuable and ramifying kinship links and structural growth points for a man's sphere of influence. Sons may herd cattle, clear fields and do farm work. Sons may supply cash earned in trade, local wage work or labour migration. A man may also be chosen as sponsor because he controls cash derived from crop sales, beers, equipment rentals, and less assuredly from the fishing or labour migration activities of men he can influence. Control of food during the periodic hunger periods, and the prestige associated with the possession of large and imposing granaries identifies men with particularly important followings.

The pining ke nuu, he explained, uses his medicines to show off by doing magical or astonishing feats; the person-who-knows-more has knowledge, but uses it only to benefit and protect those in his family or his close friends. Those-who-know, on the other hand, are persons who have achieved a reputation for helping anyone who comes to them. Their patients, after being cured, then spread their name by word of mouth as being a Zo. Flumo Tokpah was assassinated because, by winning the land tenure [Page 93] case, he was placed in a higher order speaking position than his corresponding government Zo in Malawu and was unable to back up this position of dominance with medicine protections. Thus, he was placed in the highest speaking position without having the necessary knowledge to sustain himself. He was consequently tested to see if he had the knowledge to be in such a position in the structure of power relationships between the two towns. Because his interest was more in the kwii world than in the Zo meni he did not, and so he died. Mulbah Sumo Jakolii on the other hand, his chosen successor, was recognized not only in Sucromu but throughout the entire area as a very dangerous man. It was common knowledge that just a few years before, at the graveside of a very powerful Zo, he claimed that he had killed him. That Zo, he then maintained, tried to kill him and so he made his medicine against that of his challenger. By killing him Mulbah's reputation spread, as the Zo he killed was himself known and feared. Hence, the Zo of Sucromu selected as their corporate representative in the kwii meni a man who was known to be powerful enough that they did not have the fear of his being tested to see if he could live up to his reputation as a man-who-KNOWS. 5.

Most kuu laa nuu collect several small fines a year, but they handle these matters so quietly that few kuu members become aware of the infractions. In describing prestige differences in Kpelle, it is necessary to distinguish between criteria for achieving prestige and indicators which connote it (vide Sydel Silverman on Sicilian prestige, 1966). There are three criteria for achieving high prestige among Kukaataa Kpelle. One is skill in ‘talking matters’ (e meni kpete pele kolong) [Page 119] and ‘advising’ (e liawo mo pele kolong). This can be achieved in two ways; through age or through education. For instance, young kwii people who have gone to school may be invited to attend certain types of house palaver. As they gain a reputation for advising people and ‘talking matters’ in these forums, they will be accorded the same prestige prerogatives as a taa nuu polo who has been similarly successful but is presumed to have gained his or her expertise with age. Elevation in the ritual hierarchy toward loi namu status is, however, only possible for those who meet a number of further criteria. A loi namu must have gained an association with the land by having lived and worked on the land long and hard enough to be said to have learned [Page 128] its “secrets.” Ideally, they should have been born in the town. To become a loi namu one must also earn a reputation for speaking well and advising, while serving as a taa nuu polo. One must particularly be able to speak about the history of the land, having learned it from preceding loi namu. One should be able to give advice which helps to keep peace in town; in particular, one should help avoid conflict that might lead to unnatural death. Finally, a loi namu needs to have served for several years in a position involving nurturant activity, a job that is said to prove one is capable of caring for the town. This can be accomplished by serving either as a midwife (fahlenei) or as a chief. In Kukaataa, aspiring female loi namu are invariably midwives; in other towns they may be midwives or chiefs. Aspiring male loi namu, in any Kpelle town, can only be chiefs. Each of the current male loi namu served as town chief or quarter chief in the early days of the town. Additionally, two of the men and two of the women have also served as kuu laa nuu. a service which is further cited to suggest their ability to care for people. In many cases, ill health may impede the attainment of the office of loi namu if it impedes one's ritual and secular activities. However, once the position is earned, an infirmity will not decrease the prestige of the loi namu. Taa nuu polo have achieved their positions by earning a reputation for being good at advising and talking. An individual with these attributes will increase in prestige with age.

The judicial organization of the kingdom left them free hand to interpret and apply, even to alter and create laws. The names of past Alkalai are known to everybody, and are associated with certain new [Page 102] laws or special judicial practices. Of this aspect of their activity we shall hear more at a later stage. But one point (already mentioned) must be stressed here. The office of Liman and Alkali could become hereditary; many judges and Mohammedan scholars are of Fulani stock; but this reflects only the political influence and partly also the tradition of learning in these families. As representatives of Mohammedan scholarship Liman and Alkali are only the most exalted exponents of a professional class which comprises men of every status and birth—the Mallams, ‘learned men’, who are held in high esteem by everyone. Even without rank or title, when of little and insignificant learning, they are placed above the ordinary commoner. They may marry the daughters and sisters of the high-born. The Etsu himself, descendant of a Mallam, puts a ‘Mallam’ before his name. Like his ancestors he honours and receives at his court all Mallams of reputation. They are a class between the classes, a mobile, privileged intelligentsia. Now, what are the qualifications for the position of a Ndakotsu and Etsu, and according to what principles are the ena ranks distributed? For the election of the Ndakotsu a well-established social position, good reputation, intelligence, and also a pleasant nature and, if possible, an open hand, are regarded as essential qualifications. A satisfactory financial position is essential because the Ndakotsu will be expected to entertain and to organize parties—and to do it in style. Most of these conditions also apply to the election of the group captain. The members of a newly founded Bida ena explained to me: ‘We made Mohamadu our Etsu because he is a nice fellow. We all like him. He has good connexions; you see he is invited to the court; besides, he has plenty of money, and both his father and his mother are rich. He is also ready to spend it when we have a feast and want drummers and dancers.’ On the other hand, a very ambitious young man who had been Etsu of an ena (of the second grade) and who hoped to be made Etsu again in a new, senior, association whose captain was resigning shortly, complained to me that his chances were slight, for he had not much money and could not afford the expenses which he would be expected to meet. It is implied in the nature of these qualifications that the Etsu is not always the oldest member in the group. In one ena which I analysed the Etsu was 20 when the ena started, and there were three members older than he. But as a rule he is of higher social position, and often better educated, than the rest of the members. Thus in a Bida ena which consisted almost entirely of tailors and embroiderers the captain was a weaver, the son of the Bida guild-head. In another group of a similar composition the [Page 388] captain was an expert cap-maker, who made the expensive, fashionable embroidered caps. And in a group the members of which came mostly from the classes of the nobility, the captain was the son of a late Emir. It has become the fashion for captains of Bida age-grade associations to adopt an additional, allegoric or symbolic, title, which would also give the ena its name. Bida associations compete with each other in the invention of high-sounding names, which should evince the refinement and selectness of the ena. Thus one Etsu was known as Etsu Yimani, ‘King Faith’, as the ena over which he presided prided itself of the piety of its members; another captain called himself Etsu Hankuri, ‘King Forgiveness’, for more or less the same reason; a third Etsu Turu, ‘King of the Europeans’, a title which was meant to bear witness to the fact that this ena was organized on ‘European lines’ (to be explained presently).",NA,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ff1a842fd5,ff52-001,ff52

"Barth, Fredrik 1965 “Political Leadership Among Swat Pathans” Monographs On Social Anthropology London: University of London, The Athlone Press https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=au04-004","In addition to possessing lands and wealth, a chief must command respect. His relations to his various dependents are almost entirely such that they may be broken at will by either party. Thus all Pathan males, except the few slaves, are free at any time to throw their lot in with a new leader, to hitch their wagon to a rising star. A poor man may be dependent on the hospitality and gifts of a chief for his sustenance; but if a new chief promises to give more, and has more to give, this reason for remaining with the old chief disappears. Similarly, a chief may be wealthy in inherited lands; but if he is losing this land to rival chiefs, he will be short of land to offer his followers on tenancy contracts, and his hold over them will be reduced. A man choosing a leader to whom he commits himself politically will evaluate his wealth and land and hospitality; but he must also evaluate the chief's ability to cope with critical situations. Thus the intangible factor of prestige or reputation becomes a major source of authority, an important means by which a political pretender rallies supporters. The qualities are evaluated in terms of the polar opposites izat honour, and sharm—shame. The ideal personality of a leader is virile and impetuous, given to extremes rather than compromise, sometimes unwise, but always [Page 82] brave. All leaders do not live up to this ideal equally well; but their actions are judged in relation to it, and they gain authority and attract followers in proportion to their performance as measured by such standards. A particular kind of reputation is thus a valuable source of authority for a chief: a reputation for willingness to defend his honour and interests, for violence and impetuousness, for bravery and valour. The fact that a chief may do few of his revenge murders himself matters little in this connexion. As the responsibility falls on him who paid for the murder, it is he who requires the courage—the courage to live permanently under threat of revenge from an increasing number of people. This continual threat taxes his political skill and serves as a measure of his military power. Thus feuds in defence of honour become demonstrations of the relative abilities and powers of opponents; he who wins in such feuds and defends his honour thereby demonstrates his capacity as a powerful chief and competent leader. Little wonder that people admire him and that followers flock to his men's house; his reputation serves as protection to his followers as well as to himself. Little wonder, also, that leaders are driven to adopt this pattern in their relations with their rivals. A chief who wishes to give way is subject to extreme pressures from his followers; if he does not defend his honour his reputation suffers, and his inaction is interpreted as a sign of weakness. His adversaries will inevitably [Page 86] press their advantage, to the detriment both of himself and his followers. Their interests are at stake as well as his, since his value as a protector is commensurate with his reputation as an avenger—and the risk is predominantly his, not theirs. Thus his own interests, and the expectations of his followers, as well as his personal self-esteem, all force him into the appropriate role of the status-conscious, honour-protecting, belligerent and ambitious leader. A Saint's reputation in terms of performance is evaluated by criteria quite different from those applied to chiefs. Many acts which would bring honour to a chief, such as the immoderate display of violence, would be regarded as most inappropriate in a Saint, and might seriously harm his reputation. The awe in which Saints are held by the villagers, is derived from their knowledge and mystic powers. Most people firmly believe that if they were to kill a Saint, misfortune would befall them and they would themselves probably die. This awe is enhanced by the isolation of most Saints; they do not partake in the daily life of the men's houses, or in the more ribald community amusements associated with weddings, holidays, etc. Finally, they are believed in varying degree to control mystic and miraculous powers, revealed by their ability to cure many diseases, write amulets, and so on. Denials by Saints—some of them fiercely orthodox—that they possess these special powers merely enhance their reputation. In terms of the mystic and esoteric ideas of Swat Pathans, such denials are only evidence of the great piety of the Saint. Holy things should not be disclosed. This principle of the proper concealment of miraculous powers was illustrated to me by the following story: Finally, the reputation of a Saint reaches beyond the area within which he is regularly active. It defines the widest limits of his influence and also represents his field for potential expansion. It is his reputation for holiness and piety which attracts new followers, and leads to his being nominated as peacemaker and arbitrator in areas which were formerly outside hisFIG. 7field of authority. This reputation also reaches more generally through the population of his own area, and lends authority to his disciples and dependants when they act or speak on his behalf vis-à-vis persons with whom he has no direct relations.",NA,MALE,NA,NA,MALE,MALE,MALE,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,MALE,MALE,MALE,NA,NA,MALE,371376b182,au04-004,au04

In contrast to khans, whose success requires a reputation for self-assertiveness and ruthless defense of their interests, well-regarded saints will have established a reputation for “moderation, piety, indifference to physical pleasure,” as well as “wisdom, knowledge, and control of mystical forces” (Barth 1959:101). Cultivation of these qualities, along with a dignified, pacific manner and disciplined observance of Islamic rituals, confirms villagers' respect for saints; in some cases, saints inspire awe and veneration. In Barth's words, a reputation for holinessgives their opinions great weight, particularly among the more pious or gullible sections of the population, and thus contributes to their political influence. Utilizing such a reputation, a verbally facile Saint can very profoundly influence community opinion, both among the body of villagers, by setting them up against the dominant landlords, and among the landlords themselves, by changing their point of view or threatening them with accusations of heterodoxy.

"Fürer-Haimendorf, Christoph von 1964 “Sherpas Of Nepal: Buddhist Highlanders” London: John Murray https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=ak06-001","Village lamas, in other words, are not village dignitaries, but act as private practitioners providing their priestly services wherever they are required. They do not hold any recognized or traditionally defined position within the village community, and owe any influence they may possess solely to their personality or reputation of knowledge and saintliness. Though a village without some resident lamas must inevitably experience many difficulties, there is no organized effort on the part of the village community as a whole to attract lamas or get some of its own members instructed in Buddhist scriptures and ritual. This is left to the initiative of individuals and hence more or less to chance. In 1953 there were in Khumjung the following lamas: Kusho [Page 168] Kapkye, a Khamba, who immigrated from Tibet some thirty years previously, and had the reputation of considerable learning, Lama Kiu of Gardze clan, then eighty years old, Sharap Lama, a Khamba, who had immigrated from Tibet some twenty-five years previously, Lama Karma of Thaktu clan, who was the son of a lama of Kunde, and Ongchu Lama, a man of Solu, and son-in-law of Sange Lama, who was one of the Khumjung pembu but had retired to Tengboche. Kusho Kapkye ranked as the senior lama, and presided at major rites. When he died in 1955, this rôle fell to Lama Kiu, who despite his great age and frailty presided at gomba rites and funeral services as late as May 1957. When he died in June of that year, there was no lama of sufficient status to conduct the service at his funeral, and an old lama from Phortse had to be called. In November 1957 Sharap Lama died suddenly, thus leaving the village with only Lama Karma and Ongchu Lama, both of whom were rather worldly personalities and lacking the spiritual status which qualify a lama for the independent performance of major rites. In the neighbouring village of Kunde, which shares with Khumjung one gomba and co-operates in the performance of all village rites, there was only one lama, Lama Jangbu, a widower with grown-up children, whose reputation for learning was also not very high. Yet, he was senior to the two lamas of Khumjung, and in the absence of lamas of higher status it fell to him to preside at ceremonies in the gomba. The Sherpas' attitude to pem is very different from the treatment witches receive among many Indian populations. Neither is a witch accused to her face of her doings on the evidence of spirit-media or seers, nor will any attempt be made to expel a woman identified as pem from the village where she resides. This may partly be due to the belief that an embittered witch could do more harm from a distance than she is likely to do when left unmolested, and partly to the belief that a woman may turn into a pem without her own volition. Consideration for the feelings of the other members of her family may also play a rôle in determining a community's attitude. In the case of the witch who died by drowning during my stay in Khumjung respect for her husband, who was a successful and well known sirdar of many mountaineering expeditions, had certainly played a part in muffling any public expression of condemnation of her activities. On the other hand, it was said, that her son had left [Page 265] the village and accepted employment in India largely because he was conscious of her reputation and felt awkward living in Khumjung. Similar liberality is shown in gifts to lamas and monasteries. A wealthy man may take on the restoration or decoration of a temple, and spend a great part of his liquid resources on such an enterprise. Generosity in the service of religion outshines in Sherpa eyes most other virtues, and covers a multitude of sins. One of the most respected women of Khumbu was Ngawang Samde, the sister of the pembu Ang Chunbi of Kunde. This attractive and spirited lady, who [Page 283] at the time of my visit lived with her seventh husband in a small house high above Pangboche, had at one time been a nun in Devuche. Despite her eventful marital career and the fact that several of her husbands were ex-monks who had returned to secular life on her account, she enjoyed the reputation of great piety, and continued to be a frequent and welcome visitor in the house of the abbess of Devuche. This reputation was due to her great expenditure of wealth on religious works. Her talent as a trader had enabled her to pay for the construction of mani-walls, the decoration of the temple of Pangboche, extensive pilgrimages to holy places in Tibet, and innumerable other activities of religious merit. To the average Sherpa such a life seemed far more commendable than the monotonous existence of the average virtuous housewife, absorbed in domestic duties. The genuineness of Ngawang Samde's devotion can be judged by the fact that in 1957 she and her much younger ex-monk husband had embarked on a two-year period of retreat and spiritual exercises. While in the first year the husband did not leave their isolated residence, and she maintained connections with the outside world, in the next year the rôles were to be changed and Ngawang Samde then intended to observe a year's retreat, while her husband would provide for their material needs.",NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,71d7612aae,ak06-001,ak06

Popular accounts of Taiwan usually speak of mainland Chinese as a business, government, and educational elite, and it is true that mainlanders are overrepresented, [Page 52] at least in government and education (Gates 1981). But it is important to realize that the million and a half mainlanders who came over with the defeated Nationalist forces in 1949 also included an army remnant of several hundred thousand men. The enlisted men and noncommissioned officers among them usually were not able to bring their families with them; in addition, most of them were poor, and many of them illiterate and unskilled. This sort of mainland man has often married into poor rural Taiwanese families. There were twelve of them in Ploughshare in 1973, eight married uxorilocally into village families, most of them to women with no brothers, and the other four in technically virilocal marriages but living in Ploughshare. By 1978, two of these had left and two others, both virilocally married, had moved in. Mainland men are not especially appreciated in rural Taiwanese communities, but as individuals their reception and status varies according to their own personalities and their own willingness to conform to local ways. In this regard they vary widely. Zhang Xiaoyi, a Hunanese married to a village woman, is a man who will not learn Taiwanese, at least not so that anyone can understand him, and scoffs at local religious customs. He also has a reputation for meddling in people's affairs, because he was a policeman. He is universally disliked and feared in the village, and serves to reinforce the stereotype of mainlanders as haughty and untrustworthy. On the other hand, a man like Gao Sihui, who lived in Ploughshare for six years in the 1970s, made a very different impression. He was a sergeant in the army, stationed at Yingge, then retired and bought a house in Ploughshare from a village family who moved to Dapu. He was from Jiangxi, but married a Taiwanese woman and learned to speak the language fluently, almost without an accent. He and his wife participated in local festivals, he worked alongside Taiwanese men in the mines, and he was generally well liked despite his origins.

"Wolf, Arthur P, and Chieh-shan Huang 1980 “Marriage And Adoption In China, 1845-1945” Stanford, Calif: Stanford University Press https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=ad05-051","Early writers on China were so impressed by the arches that elite families sometimes erected to commemorate a young widow who refused remarriage that the image of the “virtuous widow” is almost as well fixed in the Western conception of the Chinese family as the benevolent patriarch and the five-generation family. We must therefore be clear that when a young widow in Hai-shan refused to marry a second time, she was not motivated by concern for her reputation or a vision of a memorial arch. There were very practical reasons for remaining unmarried and a member of her deceased husband's family. For one thing, she retained her rights as the mother of her children, her best hope for support in her old age. For another, she gained (through her children) effective control of her husband's share of the family estate, an opportunity for economic independence of a kind ordinarily denied to women. The stories one hears in Hai-shan seldom touch on the theme of the virtuous widow. The more common image of the widow is that of the young woman who is forced to remarry by her husband's brothers, who want control of her share of the estate. When resistance fails, she commits suicide and takes her revenge as a ghost who drives her brothers-in-law mad.",NA,NA,NA,FEMALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,cc62ed5d29,ad05-051,ad05
"Wolf, Margery 1968 “House Of Lim: A Study Of A Chinese Farm Family” New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=ad05-003","It is characteristic of Lim Chieng-cua and his father that when they built their new house it was not quite like any other house in the village. It was a traditional house and in every way worthy of respect, [Page 30] but it was undeniably different. At that time the family was not particularly large: Lim Chieng-cua was not yet married and his elder brother wasn't living at home. Speculative neighbors might have expected the Lims to build the usual bottom wing of the U, adding a new wing, if their prosperity continued, when Lim Chieng-cua married. Instead, the Lims built a truly large house, a house that is still the largest in Peihotien. Due to the unusual individuality that has given the Lims a reputation for wisdom and leadership--a habit of seeing as important the same things as their neighbors but not feeling required to follow the conventional paths to their goals--Lim Chieng-cua and his father departed slightly from the usual practice. Rather than building a U-shaped house, they built their house in the form of a hollow square, leaving a small open courtyard in the center. The front of the square, however, deviated in no way from the conventional base for a U-shaped structure, even to the doorways for expansion at each end. They surrounded the house and the drying ground in front with a dignified brick wall, a useful addition in the city, but one rarely found in the northern villages now that bandit attacks are no longer feared. They also built a long, handsome brick pig pen, a final touch which both amused and awed their neighbors. During the prime of his life, Lim Hue-lieng's activities were more open. Because of his position in the lo mua , he was able to round up gangs of workers on a moment's notice. It was from this source that he received the majority of his income: as long as a man remained on the job Lim Hue-lieng found for him, a certain percentage of his wages went to Lim Hue-lieng. Since his loyalty to clansmen and friends was strong, Lim Hue-lieng's power had a profound effect on the prosperity of Hotien. Besides finding jobs for fellow villagers, he contributed generously to village festivals and community projects such as road building, and he built the lovely Tu Ti Kung shrine that graces the entrance to Peihotien. Without this patronage, Lim Hue-lieng's reputation in his home village would not have been good. Against him remained the stigma of being an unfilial son. And still unmarried in his father's home remained Lim A-pou, the girl his parents had adopted to be his wife. Lim Han-ci made no attempt to arrange another marriage for the girl, and she was rapidly approaching the age after which it would be difficult for her to make a good match. When Lim Han-ci's wife brought home a small girl and Lim A-pou took responsibility for the child's care, there was no longer any doubt in the village about A-pou's future. She was not to marry out of the family. If Lim Hue-lieng did not marry her, the child was to be the most Lim Han-ci could do to provide his eldest foster daughter with support in her old age. It is not difficult to see why Gioq-ki was attracted to the newspaper reporter who grew up on the mainland of China. Chang Jong-kuei is handsome, assured, and sophisticated. His carefully tailored, imported business suits look out of place on village paths, but he shows no signs of self-consciousness. Although the expression on his face suggests affability, his only contact with his village neighbors is at the gambling tables. When Gioq-ki met him, her experience with sophistication was limited to the practiced posing of young village toughs. While bold in a fight and defiant of their enemies, these young men withered at a glance from her father. They speak with confidence and respond quickly to any insult, and yet they are cautious of public opinion in their villages and accept the dictates of local custom. Chang Jong-kuei knows nothing of these restraints. He is an educated mainlander, a city dweller without obligation. Gioq-ki saw him move with ease and assurance through expensive hotels and restaurants in which her father would have looked out of place and slightly uncomfortable. Her father and the lo mua feared no one but deferred to the community; Chang Jong-kuei knew no community. The average villager would not trust Chang simply because he is not subject to the usual social pressures, but to Gioq-ki, living in the glow of her father's reputation for independence and power, Chang Jong-kuei's freedom from restraint looked like a personal quality.",NA,NA,NA,MALE,MALE,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,37549db1ee,ad05-003,ad05

In that connection, it must be noted that land, access to money, and skill in the management of patron-client and “brokerage” roles are not the only wherewithal a peasant needs to be considered legitimately powerful in rural Bangladesh. As Thorp (1977, p. 139a) has noted, “the [Page 120] kind of influence a person will have within his brotherhood is conditioned by his moral reputation.” He continues:The virtuous and pious man is held in greater respect than the person with a reputation for being irreligious, disputatious, or corrupt.

"Osella, Filippo, and Caroline Osella 2003 “Migration And The Commoditisation Of Ritual: Sacrifice, Spectacle And Contestations In Kerala, India” Contributions To Indian Sociology (NS) 37 (1 & 2): 109–39 https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=aw11-025","Particularly vulnerable to criticism are those identified as new-moneyed/avarna and hence outside the ‘usual’ circle of kuthiyottam patronage. These newcomers are invariably accused by the high-caste conservatives who dominate local kara and temple community life of being too ‘flashy’, much too concerned with showing off their wealth and making a reputation, lacking humility, respect and devotion to the goddess. In 1995 the kuthiyottam of Vijayamohan—an Izhava who has been living with his family in the United Arab Emirates for the last eighteen years and has just returned to his brother's wife's house to sponsor the sacrifice—drew unmitigated negative comments from his Nayar neighbours. While Vijayamohan and his wife greeted visitors ‘modestly’ dressed—husband wearing a khadi shirt and khadi waist-cloth, wife wearing a plain cotton saree—they were reproached for wearing ostentatious jewellery—husband donning three thick gold chains around his neck, and wife wearing a number of thick, diamond encrusted gold bangles on each wrist. The house, moreover, was adorned not only with the usual decorations and lights, but also with a large flashing neon sign reading ‘Vijayamohan kuthiyottam’ mounted next to the outline of an illuminated chariot driven by Lord Krishna rendered in twinkling multicoloured bulbs. Not only did the Nayars make a big joke (implying Vijayamohan's ignorance) out of Arjuna's absence from the chariot, but commented animatedly about ‘the absence of bhakti’, arguing that ‘in the past people were terrified that anything would go wrong, displeasing the goddess, while nowadays kuthiyottam is only a status display of sponsors.’ Arguments about the need for humility tend to obscure another important dimension of kuthiyottam: as a public event which establishes and objectifies the sponsor's status and reputation as a patron/big-man. This occurs on several levels and has a clear competitive dimension. First, as we have already mentioned, kuthiyottam is generally recognised as an extremely expensive ritual—a minimum of Rs 150,000 was needed in the early 1990s—and to undertake sponsorship is a clear demonstration of personal wealth. We calculate that by the late 1990s, the escalating cost (currently estimated by one asan at between Rs 400,000–700,000) means that anyone who was not a migrant and earning in foreign currency was likely to find kuthiyottam prohibitively expensive. We have seen minimum expenditure for successful sponsorship rise from less than Rs 100,000 when we first saw the festival in 1990 to double that figure. From our lists of sponsors, in 1995, eight out of eleven were employed outside Kerala (mostly in the Gulf), at high levels (for instance, as [Page 124] engineers); in 1996, almost all were migrants, and one a Mumbai businessman. The high-caste small-time government officials and landowners who sponsored kuthiyottams up to the 1960s are progressively being elbowed out. As one performance troupe leader remarked in 1996, ‘A poor man cannot do this. The minimum for a very small one is Rs 200,000; the most expensive one this year cost Rs 700,000.’ Preparation and organisation also require good connections—for example, in order to hire a reputed troupe of performers—and a great deal of support from relatives, friends and neighbours—to cook and serve food each night to hundreds of guests. Through the ability to mobilise extensive webs of patronage, sponsors publicly assert their reputation as ‘big-men’, a reputation augmented by the size of the crowd turning up each night to enjoy the singing and dancing, and by the number of invited VIPs spotted among the crowd. The overall behaviour of the sponsor and his family during the kuthiyottam—dress, type of food served, how they entertain guests and performers—is also ‘read’ as an indication of cultural competence and sophistication. A successful sacrifice publicly demonstrates the spiritual worthiness of the sponsor whose offerings are accepted by and please the goddess, establishing him as a major devotee. The final procession from the house of the sponsor to the temple is not only witnessed by thousands of people, but is also conducted in competition with other local kuthiyottams. Here the sponsor will try to attract the largest possible number of people, outdoing other processions not only in size, but also in the number of ‘items'—elephants, musicians, performers of ritual arts, etc.—brought to the temple. Particular effort is put into arriving at the temple around noon, when the largest crowd is present, and to not losing precedence—and hence face—by having to queue to get in to the main shrine behind the other processions. Finally, during preparation nights, local people stroll around the neighbourhood and visit a number of kuthiyottams, comparing and evaluating the style and scale of each event. Sponsors may also visit each other's functions in order to evaluate the competition, making hasty changes to their programme in order to lure additional spectators. Successful, large scale kuthiyottams are remembered—nowadays they are invariably recorded on video—and talked about for a long time.",NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,f38d1fd9b8,aw11-025,aw11
"Osella, Filippo, and Caroline Osella 2000 “Social Mobility In Kerala: Modernity And Identity In Conflict” Anthropology, Culture And Society London: Pluto Press https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=aw11-029","Family, personal and community mobility trajectories are inscribed upon a person's life-cycle and identity; mobility can be traced by following such movements. The order in which we will look at the various fields we have chosen bear a rough correspondence both to an imaginary life-cycle and to parallel processes of capital accumulation and conversion or conservation. Chapter 2 discusses employment, the first challenge to face young men like Premadasan: the business of making a living, preferably in some occupation better than that of one's father and ideally in some employment permitting accumulation of significant savings. Time and again migration has provided an answer to this imperative. Female employment has also been an important prestige barometer, most women claiming ‘housewife’ status and female participation in manual labour or unskilled work being a marker of poverty and indicative of a weak prestige position. Chapter 3 focuses on the next stage in a young man's life, delayed until he is settled in secure employment and has made some contribution to his parents' household, that is, marriage, another arena important for family status, as strategic alliances are made and prestigious dowries displayed. Chapter 4 considers one central process in which employment income is used and cash begins to be converted into symbolic and sometimes cultural capital: consumption, covering both longer-term investments and more ephemeral purchases. This chapter highlights the central and necessary goal of all long-term projects of [Page 37] social mobility: conversion over time of wealth – economic capital – into status and prestige through judicious accumulation of symbolic and cultural capital. Chapter 5 analyses an area of social life providing privileged arenas for those seeking to assert reputation: religion. While a group's religious practices are weakly indicative of relative prestige, the religious domain acts as a specific and highly prestigious opportunity for strategic consumption, specifically opportunities to ‘sponsor’ festivals and sacrifices. In contrast to arenas of production and consumption, in which class mobility takes priority, religion is a sphere in which Izhava caste status is foregrounded. It therefore becomes an arena for competition and confrontation with high-caste Hindus who widely resist and resent Izhava attempts to participate in religious life on an equal footing, as ‘Hindus’. This leads us on to a field of great importance this century for the would-be mobile, and in which the struggle for power – arguably, following Bourdieu (for example 1990: 122f, 1994: 56), the most valuable of goods – is openly manifested. Chapter 6 examines Izhava political participation, considering both macro-levels, when Izhavas band together to protect or defend group interests, and micro-levels, where families and individuals seek involvement in agencies of locally exercised power. Like religion, politics is an arena in which mature men convert wealth into prestige; consolidate their position within the locality (often after a lifetime of working away); and manipulate relations of patronage and clientism in attempts to enhance status. Finally, we turn towards micro-politics or personal interaction, crucial to Izhava longer-term ambitions of mobility away from an untouchable past, and a field in which individual subjects act in small but significant ways to undermine or assert caste hierarchies. Chapter 7 examines friendship and ‘passing’ as Nayar or Christian: some ways in which Izhavas seek to subvert the strong barrier of caste threatening to undermine successes in class mobility. We also consider ways in which caste prejudice and hierarchy continues, turning both to the question of what is ‘community identity’ in the 1990s, and – following recently intensifying debates on the nature of 1990s caste – to the more abstract question of the putative prevalence of social and cognitive principles of hierarchy which work against social fluidity and mobility. Work is important in the life-cycle: through different relationships to work, gender and maturity are expressed. Group drives towards mobility are inscribed upon trajectories travelled by gendered individuals: young women's adoption of nurturing and housewifely roles, whether accompanied or not by withdrawal from public arenas of work, confirms personal status while contributing towards family prestige; female participation in or withdrawal from certain types of paid employment are indices of family status. A broad gendered division of labour exists in the work of pursuing familial and personal mobility, in which young men's primary duty is accumulation of wealth and young women's the pursuit of reputation, female withdrawal from labour being a relatively cheap and easily achievable form of prestige. Things such as gold and fashion clothing, more or less accessible to any villager, fail to provide the exclusivity and solidity required of higher-level symbolic or cultural capital. As items used for decoration and improvement of the self, they refer only obliquely to the larger mobility unit of home and family. Long-term mobility strategies demand that cash be spent on goods and services which construct durable prestige, improve future life-chances and build up the quality and reputation not merely of the cash-earning person but of the entire household unit. A first level of spending by young householders or potential householders is directed towards consumer durables. Young men buy refrigerators, televisions and so on for their natal house, which they may eventually take with them when they make the later major investment of building their own house. Emergence of low-caste nouveaux-riches as patrons is invariably accompanied by attempts to discredit them: Baby is often described as dishonest (kalian) or a hoodlum (goonda). Like other Gulfanmar, he is widely believed to have made his earnings on the black, smuggling gold and dollars; several people told us that he owned a printing press for turning out counterfeit notes. Baby's reputation as money-lender is equally tarnished: people gossip that he demands sexual favours from the wives and daughters of defaulters. Raman's nickname, ‘Chicken Biryani’, invokes both his financial sound-ness and his wide-ranging sociability, twin pillars supporting his reputation and popularity. The nickname refers to his famed prodigious appetite for the [Page 204] fragrant luxury which is a speciality of Muslim and Christian communities. Occasionally in his younger days, rather than eat the usual toddy-shop (chilli chicken, fish fry, boiled tapioca) or roadside stall (chilli omelette, dosa) fare, he would persuade his friends after a few drinks to accompany him to a Christian meals hotel where he treated everybody to his favourite dish. Family responsibilities have long since put paid to treats in town, but Raman's work as Agricultural Cooperative Society clerk brings him into contact with many people, meaning many wedding invitations. Non-Hindu friends never hesitate to invite him, knowing that he will be a good guest; after two or even three helpings of biryani he will praise the wedding for weeks to the many customers coming to him for seeds, fertilisers or pesticides, thereby adding to his hosts' reputation. Kunjappan was a very poor Sasthamuri man, with a neighbourhood reputation as a cheat and thief. He worked part-time in a Christian-owned ration-shop while his wife sat at a makeshift stall selling loose cigarettes and tea. Supplementary remittances from a son in the military dried up after the son's marriage and left the household in penury. One evening a neighbour noticed a gold chain missing; she asked around at several places including Kunjappan's house, but nobody found it. Her father consulted an astrologer who confirmed common suspicion that Kunjappan had found the chain and kept it. That night, Kunjappan got very drunk at the toddy-shop before coming around all the houses in the street saying, ‘I am not a thief; I didn't take the chain. Come and search my house.’ Nobody went, saying that he had probably already sold it. In the morning, his mother found him hanging dead in his roadside tea-stall. His body hung for several hours before anybody could be persuaded to cut it down and deal with the funerary and legal arrangements, although Kunjappan's family were staunch Congress members and clients of a local wealthy Christian family: nobody from either group was willing to get involved in the scandal. Eventually a CPI panchayat member from another neighbourhood visited the house to deal with the police report, the death certificate, the funeral arrangements and payment of an insurance claim. Kunjappan's mother, widow and the entire family now owe allegiance both personally to the man who helped them and – through him–to the CPI.",NA,NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,77c367866d,aw11-029,aw11

Even if the two never actually reside in the same house, the union is considered proper so long as the man contributes to the support of the woman and children. When the union is terminated, if the father simply deserts the woman and her child or children, there is some public disapproval of both parties. This takes the form of gossip, and perhaps mild ostracism. If a woman makes several short-term alliances which result in children unrecognized by the various fathers, she acquires a reputation of being rather stupid, hard to live with, and somewhat loose morally. She may eventually have difficulty finding a man with whom she can establish even a semi-permanent relationship. A man's reputation may also be hurt if he repeatedly begets children without recognizing them.

"Kerns, Virginia 1983 “Women And The Ancestors: Black Carib Kinship And Ritual” Urbana: University of Illinois Press https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=sa12-004","This well-founded piece of folk wisdom springs from the fact that social organization is fundamentally dyadic: rooted in relations of reciprocity between individuals, who control their own labor and its products. While men and women universally recognize their financial obligations to primary kin, meeting them is another matter. Obligations to others are very diffuse. In either case, no one can compel anyone else to “share.” The only resort is all manner of friendly persuasion or, should that fail, a threat or show of personal force. For the most part, individuals decide what and with whom they will share. Reputation is almost wholly based on personal (not collective) evaluations of an individual's “generosity,” and of other personal qualities such as honesty, wit, and mettle. People are held responsible for their own conduct from early childhood, and judged accordingly. Most conflict is interpersonal and generally centers on exchange: how individuals choose to share money and other forms of personal property. Reputation, the assessment of personal worth, is based on an individual's conduct with others (cf. Dwyer 1978: 233). Villagers agree that a “decent” person is generous and honest; a “worthless” person is dishonest, stingy, hángi-, or poor, magábari- (literally, having no life). But people's evaluations of specific others differ, since their personal relations with them vary. Because most exchange is dyadic, evaluations of generosity often vary enormously from one person to the next. Ritual sponsorship provides nearly the only instance in which there is community consensus about personal reputation. People who cannot, or choose not, to sponsor a required rite for one of their ancestors deny food and drink not only to the dead but also to other villagers, the incumbent guests. Showing “gratitude” to the dead necessarily entails the display of generosity to the living. Sexual activity changes over the life cycle and serves to define the different life stages. At any age, men's and women's expected conduct and attitudes about sexuality also differ. For a man or woman to seek sexual pleasure is regarded as “natural,” yet women face certain constraints in this pursuit. Females learn to exercise more control over their sexuality from an early age. They show greater modesty about their bodies; ideally they confine themselves to one sexual partner, preferably for an extended period of time; they are expected to take certain “precautions” to protect others from the harmful effects of their menstrual blood. Men and women hold responsibility for their own sexual conduct, but a woman's reputation depends on sexual restraint, while a man gains esteem for sexual initiative and prowess. A man known as a “breeder” (the father of many children, especially by different women) enjoys prestige among other men. A large crowd is desirable for both mystical and social reasons. Spirits of the dead are not satisfied with lackluster, poorly attended rituals. In the case of chugú and düg□ they may demand that the rite be repeated. Well-attended rituals also provide visible evidence that the sponsors are “able” to afford the expense of feeding a large number of people, that they are capable of “supporting the crowd.” Attendance is seen as a tangible measure of reputation as well, a gauge of the esteem of others for the organizer, other sponsors, and the deceased. A large crowd, it is said, makes them feel “appreciated.”",NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NEUTRAL,FEMALE,NA,NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,601092006e,sa12-004,sa12
"Nader, Laura 1990 “Harmony Ideology: Justice And Control In A Zapotec Mountain Village” Stanford, Calif: Stanford University Press https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=nu44-031","In a small community the judges know the contestants, and the litigant's character and reputation enter into judicial outcomes. In one case, the secretary reported the court's evaluation of the litigant. The transcript noted that the contestant's word was “unreliable” because she was known as “habitually irresponsible,” a “liar,” and a “slanderer.” Since the judge did not trust her, he put her in jail. She would have assuredly lost her case, since she was treated like a criminal, had she not appealed to the district court. In another case, the defendant, a married man, was charged with rape of another woman. During the trial the municipio initiated a second complaint [Page 91] against him based on hearsay, for being remiss in his financial obligations to his family. Character and reputation do affect outcome. The presidente is a citizen, not a professional, giving his year of service to his fellow Taleans. Whether he spends most of his time hearing cases or doing other work depends on his reputation and his personal style. He decides cases without using written law, resolving conflict by minimizing the sense of injustice and outrage felt by the parties to a case. Ideally, his investigation of the facts is nondirective and flexible; there are no rigid rules of evidence. The presidente's stance, when patient, encourages litigants to decide what issues should be discussed and to present both real and abstract evidence to support their claims; there is no concept of objective truth. In family cases he is more likely to be directive and paternalistic and seeks to remind kinfolk of their responsibilities to the community. He is expected to use what he knows of town affairs and is theoretically selected for such knowledge. The presidente is expected to render a verbal and written agreement for each case—an agreement that town consensus would consider equitable. He is not expected to explain the basis of his decision. Legal documents do include the litigants' statements, the agreement, and/or a statement mentioning the fine, if any. It is what happens to the litigants that is central to the legal documents, not the reasoning of the judge in the case. Both of these defendants were repeat offenders in this court, but the real offense in the case had to do with Nino's taking authority into his own hands: “You put out your hand,” and “You cannot make justice by your own hand.” Nino had a reputation for bucking authority, especially the village authority. He was a well-to-do man who runs a business in Talea but is seemingly always found on the street where the action is, where he was all too often making justice by his own hand. Self-help is disapproved of in Talea, because it is correctly perceived as a threat to village autonomy. Actually some years later Nino damaged the corporate entity by actively participating in a religious cleavage between traditional Catholics and newly converted Protestants. As I look back on the cases in which Nino appeared, the building toward a break with municipal authority was clearer than any simple reading of individual recorded cases might have indicated. The right to exercise ultimate authority belongs only to the town officials. Even in cases of self-defense, litigants are told not to take authority into their own hands. This case also illustrates that from the point of view of the litigants, the use of supporters to soften a judgment may have an effect, although not always. In Case 64, involving one of the principals, a local merchant who in a state of drunkenness threatened the life of another, the pressure of supporters was formidable; so was the resistance to pressure. The issue was physical assault on the sindico. The defendant was a well-to-do citizen from a good family who, even though he drank a good deal, had been able to accumulate a large amount of capital. He was a generous and well-liked person who was seen as a good citizen. This case was taken from observations recorded during the summer of 1965. The defendant had been drinking all afternoon and was quite drunk. He arrived at a cantina where the sindico had stopped to buy some cigarettes. The defendant was brandishing a 22-caliber rifle. He got into an argument with the sindico and finally assaulted him. The sindico ordered the policía to put the defendant in jail.
The sequence of events that followed was colored by the fact of drunkenness; both the sindico and the defendant were drunk, although the defendant was more drunk. As soon as the presidente arrived, he took charge of the case. But supporters also arrived to intercede on behalf of the defendant. The sindico kept insisting that the defendant had to stay in jail until the next day, but his supporters argued that their friend was gente—a gentleman—and therefore too important to be jailed. The defendant was brought in, still drunk. He slapped the sindico on the back, and everybody laughed. [Page 226] In the end he was released and taken home. After the defendant and his supporters left, the presidente, the sindico, and the tesorero [treasurer] continued to talk about the gran delito [the serious crime].
The next day the case was brought before the alcalde. Since the sindico was involved, he could not hear the case. The woman who owned the cantina where the action had occurred gave testimony. The defendant was placed back in jail with a whole array of supporters talking to him. The supporters came into the alcalde's office led by a schoolteacher. The teacher tried unsuccessfully to intimidate the alcalde. Then he tried to explain away the actions of the defendant by saying that the defendant was drunk, that he was really a sensitive person and a good citizen, and then once again he tried to use drinking as an excuse. The alcalde said, “For whatever reason he did it, the fact remains, and it is a big problem.”
Two more supporters came in and argued with the sindico, while two others came in to speak with the alcalde; one was a relative of the defendant, the other a ritual kinsman. They seemed to be protective of the defendant's reputation and urged that things be held in confidence. The defendant was allowed out of jail to have lunch. The policía showed esteem for the man. The relationship between the defendant and the sindico was made clear by the defendant; the defendant's father's sister was the sindico's mother. The sindico was described by the defendant, his cousin, as a rustic type who took things too seriously. As the day progressed, supporters and the sindico went in and out to speak with the alcalde.
At 3:00 P.M. the defendant entered with the teacher to see the alcalde. The alcalde asked the teacher to leave, though the teacher objected, saying that he was a friend and wanted to help the defendant with the agreement that was to be drawn up. When the teacher had left, the alcalde read the testimony to the defendant and asked him to identify the gun, which the defendant did. The alcalde then began to talk about the seriousness of the crime, saying that for four years after a serious crime like this one the defendant could not take on any civic duties. “One does not have the rights of a citizen,” he said. “When a person like you gets into trouble, it is really different.” The defendant asked, “How much is my fine?” After some back and forth, the alcalde said 500 pesos. When the defendant objected, the alcalde said, “If you give us 500 pesos, we will be able to write another proceeding [acta] that will say that the 500 pesos was a voluntary contribution.” The defendant went out to get the money and upon his return began once again to argue with the sindico in Zapotec. The teacher returned and joined in also. The main defense now was that there was no intention to harm and that therefore there was no case. The defendant paid the fine, and the record did not incriminate him.
Clearly the defendant was not only a man with many supporters but a good citizen in the town, a principal, after all. This case took all day to hear.",NA,MALE,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,a4c850d37b,nu44-031,nu44

Election depends on a man’s reputation in the community. He must be known as a good fellow, a capable executive, and a serious individual. A previous criminal record, although corrective punishment has been administered, practically eliminates a man’s chances for an official position. Likewise, a bad reputation for arguing or fighting in a boisterous manner when drunk is injurious to a candidacy. The [Page 203] spirit of democracy that the governing positions illustrate is consistent with a social organization so lacking in formal groupings.

As a part of the honor paid to him, he is presented with many drinks, as well as a special olla of tesgüino which he himself must serve. The result is that he has to drink more than the others present. Drunkenness is not so serious if the shaman has an established reputation. The doctor Patricio became so intoxicated at one curing that he could hardly proceed, and yet the people did not seem to mind. Other cases, however, indicate that sobriety is the best policy for the ambitious young shaman. In general, the shaman who becomes drunk regularly becomes talkative as well and is considered too human to have much influence over the powers of illness. Above all, the shaman is the maintainer of social customs. His duties as a ceremonialist make him a defender of the old order. He is careful to observe all rules of etiquette and decorum.

The tesgüinada is the religious group, the economic group, the entertainment group, and the group at which disputes are settled, marriages arranged, and deals completed. It is at the tesgüinada with his set of neighbors, and under the influence of alcohol, that the individual has a chance to play the roles in his repertoire which remain dormant during his isolation. The man with leadership aspirations gets to his feet and gives a “sermon,” which also functions to reinforce moral norms, and to dramatize status position. Deals are made for animals or maize. A ceremony or race may be arranged. It is at the tesgüinada that the unmarried may find a mate, or the married can vary sexual experience. Kinship roles outside those of the nuclear family rarely find a chance or mood for expression except at one of these inebriated get-togethers. Here also, the clown makes his reputation, and much laughing follows stereotyped sexual jokes and horseplay. The ritual role of the native religious practitioner is largely played out in this atmosphere. The tesgüinada provides practically the only opporunity for the release of aggressive impulses, and frequently a fight occurs for one reason or another. The motive is often sexual jealousy, and not infrequently the result is injury, and sometimes even death. This is in contrast to the virtual absence of fighting outside of tesgüinadas . Reputation as an owerúame is one factor which, combined with other qualities, may contribute to any individual’s overall prestige, but it alone may also serve as an avenue of status mobility. Because of the indefiniteness of the qualifications, many men claim some owerúame powers. Assertion of one’s supernatural attributes is thus another of the few ways a Tarahumara may achieve higher status. When a man is inclined to leadership he may find himself requested to give sermons or lectures when the tesgüino is flowing. If he becomes a person of substance and is aggressive in the ways described he will rise, for these are the qualities of the influential man. A reputation for such personal attributes is built up over the years concomitantly with wealth, which is taken as one sign of having them. Young Tarahumara men are seldom leaders, but age in itself is not the critical criterion; in neither the gentile or bautizado areas are extremely old men found in any position of authority. It takes considerable time to develop substance and build a reputation, but after a certain point men feel that they have done their duty, and the physical vigor thought to be requisite for leadership becomes attenuated. The leader must be able to drink, speak, and work forcefully. Dionicio Inápuchi, the father-in-law of Patricio, was an example of a person with age and wealth, but who lacked the other qualities for Tarahumara leadership. Dionicio had never been siríame or even warúala, though he was at the time at least 65, and was the oldest man in the area. He worked hard, was one of the wealthiest men on Inápuchi, and had a reputation for not making trouble. On the other hand, he had never been regarded as wise, nor had he sought leadership for himself. He made tesgüino regularly, but did not organize other group activities. His fairly large herd of animals and ample productive fields were to pass into control of Patricio Inápuchi at his death because the latter had married his only daughter. Dionicio had no ability as a curer and despite his age did not perform as a sawéame . Valencio Pisachi was a man of about 50 who had never held more than minor official positions. His prestige was generally low. He had a large family (seven children), which he had difficulty supporting. He is the person referred to earlier as one who had descended rather than ascended on the economic scale. Over the years he dissipated most of the wealth which he had inherited from his father, and because of his laziness he allowed his wife’s fields to be taken over by others (see later discussion of land disputes). Valencio frequently made trouble at tesgüinadas when he was younger, and during our stay he was not invited often to drinking parties at Inápuchi because of his long-standing land dispute with both Ignacio and Román Inápuchi.

In Wogeo, as elsewhere in Oceania, reputation is enhanced by giving presents. Theft is not always denied, and if the culprit is a kokwal he may offer a larger pig in return, thus enhancing his reputation by his generosity. Kaunara, the young kokwal of Kinaba, did this when he and some of his followers had killed a pig belonging to Kumun of Job. They had set out with nets intending to capture a wild pig, but instead this one had wandered into the snare and was killed in the rather foolish hope that no one would know. As it was only half tame and did not always return to the village at night there was a chance of escaping detection. In any case, the hope was doomed to disappointment, for the news reached Kumun. That evening he took a few relatives and went to Kinaba, where he threw down four dry coco-nuts in the street and called out loudly: “This is pig food. Call up your pigs to eat, and I will choose one of them in exchange for the one of mine your people stole.” Kaunara came down from inside his house, and replied: “Am I not a kokwal. I have boars' tusks (the insignia of noble birth). I can give you a pig, two pigs, three pigs, four pigs. Take that one. It has been my pillow since its birth.” He pointed to an enormous beast which he was fattening for some ceremony. The reference to his pillow implied only that the pig was a pet, for the animals sleep beneath the house, not inside it. He was thus most ostentatious with his generosity. Kumun, ashamed at the offer of more than the equivalent of his loss, walked away, showing that he could also be liberal. But Kaunara was not to be outdone, and ordered his clan to capture the pig and carry it to Job. His action was expensive, but he derived prestige from it and avoided all blame for the theft.

There is little doubt but that her behavior was hysterical. I had known her very well, having spent much time in her house observing her baby, and it was difficult for me to realize that this was Taveliar. Normally she is quiet, taciturn, not given to exaggerated movements of any kind. The contrast was glaring. This hysterical seizure lasted about fifteen minutes, after which, she passed out of it, singing along with the rest, but in her normal voice, and patently exhausted. “13.

Now Tavelear has the reputation of being a sensuous woman, and Tom often remarked how difficult it had been to satisfy her sexually when he had had an affair with her. Now her husband had returned, she had been with him for two days, and could not yet have intercourse, which for her constituted a severe frustration.

Tongan society stereotypically expects men to be promiscuous, particularly when young and unmarried, while prescribing that unmarried women remain virginal. Similar expectations are very common cross-culturally, and strike a familiar chord in Western contexts (e.g., Holland & Eisenhart 1990; Lancaster 1992:235-278; Moffatt 1989:181-245; Parker 1991:30-66; Sanday 1990). This state of affairs has deep roots in the Tongan social order, and articulates with many other aspects of Tongan society and culture. In this traditional order, which is necessarily [Page 15] oversimplified here, a woman's virginity is guarded by her brothers and male cousins, with whom she is in an avoidance taboo, but by whom her reputation, and therefore that of her family, are protected and her welfare looked after. The contemporary social reality, particularly in town, is that virginity is only of concern in the case of high-ranking women (and this remark is again an oversimplification as high-ranking Tongans are also commonly very Westernised in sexual and other matters). For most women, sexual favours are commodities which must be repaid, through gifts, outings, etc. Thus heterosexual sex is conceptualised as an exchange (cf. Yelvington 1996:320 on Trinidad), and is a potentially onerous activity for both women and men, although the commodity being expended is different for each gender group: men expend material resources, while women expend sexual favours, which can decrease their potential for upward mobility on the marriage market (see Ortner 1981). Prestige also enters the picture, with men gaining prestige from sex while women lose it. A man gains particular prestige in the eyes of his peers (and of society at large, although in a more complex manner) when he successfully coaxes as many women as possible into providing sexual favours, but gets away with giving as little as possible in return (cf. Yelvington 1996:317). Affective bonds do figure in premarital relations, but they are downplayed compared to the Maussian aspects of the transaction, although they are elaborated in bracketed contexts such as mournful love songs (hiva kalala), which are sung principally by younger men.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,MALE,FEMALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3a5642eef9,ou09-128,ou09

Rivalries within the chiefly order both reflected and constituted the inconsistencies within the principles of ranking: seniority, genealogical connections through males, and sororal superiority. As long as collateral and cognatic claims—by brothers and sisters—remained key in determining succession to chiefly title, and as long as chiefly women's products were both similar to nonchiefly women's goods and needed to demonstrate high status, the chiefly estate could not become a chiefly class.

Status is calculated in context and is relative: that is, in any given context, a person's status is relative to that of whoever else is present. Status is primarily determined by seniority (chronological or genealogical), gender, and kinship relations. Another more flexibly determined factor is reputation, which can be enhanced by education, wealth, generosity, and involvement in church-related activities. Unlike ranked relations, status relations can sometimes involve competition and rivalry, particularly in regard to the more readily contested criterion of reputation. Bernstein notes that “there is a continuous struggle for status within households and families. Siblings vie for power and prestige, husbands and wives strive for more status and control, and distant relatives invoke different rules, customs, and circumstances to better their relative position” (1983, 42; and see Marcus 1978).",NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eb156d3564,ou09-107,ou09

Winning or quitting in any particular situation can have diverse effects on a person's status or reputation over his life history. I had the impression, and Tongans widely believe, that some notable persons have had long-term, secret strategies for managing situations of status competition in which they have been involved, but I could not in fact determine decisively whether any persons I knew operated in such a Machiavellian fashion. For the most part, situations were managed as they developed, and while most persons were sensitive to and skillful in managing their social performances, few, if any, had the power or inclination to engage in long-term planning of establishing a continuity for participation across situations of status rivalry. Concluding whether or not a person is poto (“clever”) in Tonga is a meta-assessment or judgment by the public of a person as a performer in status rivalry sequences, situationally or in terms of his cumulative social reputation. Nowadays, poto is frequently used to refer to a high level of achievement in formal education, but its traditional folk usage is related to the laudatory assessment of personal skills in status rivalry sequences (See Rogers, 1976: Chapter 8). The poto person is not necessarily one who has dominated in rivalry or maximized personal gain, but more subtly is one who, either as modest, generous winner or quitting loser, has managed a confrontation in solving the problem for himself and the group of setting steady-state values, and at the same time, defining relative status differentials among co-equivalents. In this sense, the withdrawing rival might be judged as more poto than a winner in a particular [Page 267] situation—as the one whose action is critical for setting limits which restore steady-state controls. From the perspective of long-term reputation, a poto person is generally skilled in managing variable outcomes of rivalry sequences in which he is involved, sometimes as winner and at other times as loser. In contrast, a person is vale (“stupid,” “socially inept”) if he is consistently either an excessive winner or loser in rivalry sequences. In Example 1, both Tane and Kapu were seen as men with poto reputations, which made their standing for office appropriate. Yet, Kapu was admired and praised for his withdrawal, while Tane's behavior as winner was merely considered proper. In Example 2, Sione was known locally for his vale reputation, while Alipate was not seen as particularly poto nor was any spectator attention paid to the manner of his withdrawal from competitive flirtation. To minimize the risk of being judged vale a common tendency in Tonga is to avoid all situations where one might have to perform under public scrutiny. However, since persons are just as likely to collide into sequences of rivalry (built-up partially by spectator encouragement) as choose to be in them, participation in interpersonal competition as a rival is probably experienced by most Tongan males.",NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2bcdd9713d,ou09-126,ou09

However, this man was well-educated abroad, holds an important bureaucratic post, and exhibits the life-style of a western middle-class commoner elite. His situation is a complex example of how an interest in claiming chiefly status locally (on Mana'ia's estate) is combined with a societal reputation as a commoner who has achieved status through education and government service. The dualism in his social identities partially derives from the blurring of the formal boundaries between noble and commoner in his father's attempt through litigation to transfer to him the Mana'ia title and estates. It is interesting to contrast the situation of the loser in the Mana'ia case with the loser, Z, in the Vakalā case. In the former case, the outcome did not negatively influence the loser's future development and social standing (which, as the prominent lawyer's son, did not hinge on winning the title); in the latter case, the failure of Z to win the title was devastating to his social standing, based previously on the prestige of his father's, Y's, position.",NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1d9a4061e7,ou09-086,ou09
"Marcus, George E 1978 “The Nobility and the Chiefly Tradition in the Modern Kingdom of Tonga” In Memoirs, 166 Wellington: The Polynesian Society https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=ou09-111","From the point of view of the nobility, the typical image of the commoner is either the aspiring, poto ‘educated’ individual without □eiki status, who is attempting to cross boundaries into an arena of high government position that has been dominated by the nobility and expatriates, or else the rural peasant farmer, cultivating his □api tukuhau on an hereditary or government estate. Increasing urbanisation and the concentration of the “modern sector”, in terms of both facilities and enterprise, on Tongatapu and around the capital of Nuku□alofa, has tarnished the status value of staying in the rural districts or outer island groups as a farmer. The tu□a in modern Tonga, in its most pejorative, low status sense, refers to one who has no alternative but to labour on his or his family's land. It implies failure to advance in the sphere of education, which has until recently been the main channel of mobility from the village, or failure to be a particularly enterprising or enthusiastic farmer. Successful farming has been one source of adult male reputation in the rural context and an alternative basis for acquiring the means for a man or his children to move into wider social spheres. Like law and the Konisitutone, education (□ako) has been another cornerstone and symbol of change in compromise culture Tonga. Aside from its being a practical stepping-stone which provides access to the new arenas of social mobility within church and state employment, education as a mark of personal status has long been valued for itself. The concept of institutionalised learning was obviously accepted by Tongans through missionary influence and a Western model, but Kavaliku has suggested that the tangata poto ‘the clever man’ has traditionally been an ideal of Tongan ethos which merely found a form as the educated man through culture contact. Whereas traditionally a person could demonstrate his poto in a variety of skills including fishing, warfare, agriculture, and courting women, the concept of poto is now thought of specifically as success in moving through the hierarchy of indigenous educational opportunities for which a government job or church office would be a possible reward. However, even if a person does not gain a position, as many do not, his [Page 108] demonstrated poto in school still gains him recognition and reputation for cleverness among peers. A person is still called poto in this or that skill, but as a poto person he must have had some success within the educational system. Before educational opportunity accelerated and diversified in the post-war period, most of those attending post-primary schools went either to Wesleyan Tupou College or to the Government's Tonga College. That educational experience had important effects on the present generation of middle-age Tongan males. First, school experience established lifelong reputations and relationships among Tongans who were in the same school at the same time. For males, being in school together during their talavou or adolescent period, which is a liminal time of freedom and fellowship, gave many of them a familiarity with one another that would otherwise have been blocked by the pattern of keeping social relationships within kin networks. War service on Tongatapu did somewhat the same thing for the present adult generation. Consequently, Tongans are likely to have a direct knowledge of many of their contemporaries as a result of having known them at one of the colleges, although they do not associate with one another on a regular basis. Furthermore, regardless of the succeeding fortunes of an individual, how he is thought of — his reputation — is strongly influenced by what sort of schoolmate he was. Some men are known for their pau□u ‘mischievousness’, some for their kākā ‘deceitfulness, slipperiness’, and some for their poto ‘overall intelligence’ — all traits established as talavou attending school together.",NA,NA,NA,MALE,NEUTRAL,NA,MALE,NEUTRAL,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,NEUTRAL,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1e22204496,ou09-111,ou09

"Wagley, Charles 1977 Welcome of Tears: The Tapirapé Indians of Central Brazil New York: Oxford University Press https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=sp22-016","As usual, Urukumu was not revenged immediately, but his execution was not forgotten. On his death Urukumu left a young son of about six years of age. When I returned in 1953, this boy, Chawachowa, was a young man, and, for lack of available girls of his own age among the Tapirapé, he had married a Carajá girl. By 1953, Irawú had become a man of prestige and he had changed his name to Wantanamu, the name of the shaman and household leader whose death had incited him to kill Urukumu in 1941. By 1953, this new Wantanamu had the reputation of being a strong panché. The Tapirapé villagers were already somewhat frightened of him. In fact, his reputation for aggression had extended beyond the Indians themselves. Valentim Gomes, the Indian officer at Posto Heloisa Alberto Torres and my old companion, complained that Wantanamu was hard to handle. He had killed two cows that belonged to the SPI post. The local Brazilians spoke of Wantanamu as a caboclo de coragem (a courageous Indian), and some referred to him as “the chief of the Tapirapé.” Wantanamu owned a rifle and always walked about armed. It would seem that his own reputation both as a shaman and as an overly aggressive leader had now grown strong enough for him to fear for his own life. In 1965, when we returned again to New Village, I heard of the end of Wantanamu's career—and perhaps of shamanism among the Tapirapé.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,b1ac0e1cbe,sp22-016,sp22

These bags are made by Kogi women who use thick, eyed steel needles - formerly of bone - in their manufacture. All day long the women, when not occupied with other menial tasks, can be seen sewing these simple objects which have many uses, especially since the Kogi have practically no basketry, and netted bags are their principal carrying utensils. The agave fibres are twisted with a bow-driven spindle and may be of varying thickness. The technique of manufacture is that of knotless netting; while a woman works at a bag she turns it continously in her hands, building up the bag with spiralling rows. Even while nursing her baby or while walking over steep mountain trails a Kogi women will continue her work; in fact, a woman’s reputation as a wife and a mother depends in part on her dedication to this activity. Symbolically these bags represent the womb (or placenta) of the Mother, and the sewing of bags is therefore a ritual activity by which the women express a principle of fertility. According to the Kogi, the two movements - the one implied by each mesh and the other consisting of the slow circular turning of the bag in the women’s hands - imitate the movements of the moon. It is believed that the 28-day lunar cycle is closely related to female fecundity, and that women must never stop sewing these bags unless they want to interrupt an important biological cycle. As soon as a women has finished a bag she immediately starts to make a new one with the remaining thread of the last bag, even if this means only a few rows of meshes that form a small disk, the centre of the bottom of the new bag. It is quite obvious that the sewing of carrying bags by women corresponds to the men’s spinning and weaving. The symbolic significance of these technological processes is absolutely central to Kogi cosmology, religion and philosophy.",NA,NA,NA,FEMALE,FEMALE,NA,NA,NA,FEMALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5b3137a1fe,sc07-008,sc07

Everyone feels scorn and disregard by the generality very bitterly. Certainly a person sometimes recalls the punishments that the Supreme Being administers, but concern about a favorable reputation proves incomparably more effective with him. For the violation of personal rights, everyone procures ample satisfaction for himself, according to the circumstances, for the Selk'nam never forgives (p. 651). One almost never bestows praise for heroic deeds, but one's respect increases for the person who has accomplished them. Anyone who is unfaithful with regard to law and custom is quite generally deprived of any esteem. The wiy[unknown] k[unknown] é[unknown] n , the wrestling of two men in order to test their own strength, is most frequently practiced. For the participants, this is an exercise and sporting performance; for the spectators, entertainment rich in enjoyment. It is friends or neighbors, even relatives, who mutually challenge each other if they feel the desire and if several families are contentedly sitting together under the open sky, or if one wishes to bring a little change into the conversation. This game serves the desire for movement, to pass the time, and self-love. Although the two opponents seize each other resolutely and gradually increase their efforts to the utmost, the wrestling never degenerates into ill-feeling, even though the stronger one finally knocks the weaker one to the ground with such force that he can sometimes get up only with difficulty. Many a man may be badly hurt, to be sure, but in the long run he may not escape further fights, but must venture on to increasingly stronger opponents in order not to get the reputation of a weak coward.

There are sharp contrasts in the popularity of merchants: some were felt to be honorable characters and said to be popular, while others were clearly unpopular. By describing their popularity or unpopularity, the authors of the sagas inform us of their reputation and the opinion of thirteenth-century society towards such men. The merchant Hrafn in Vopnfirðinga saga was wealthy and miserly, and the chieftains Geitir and Brodd-Helgi apparently felt that it was quite justified to dispose of him, with the aim of acquiring his riches (ÍF 11:28–30). They appear to have trusted that they would lose none of their respect even if they rid themselves of such a miserly and therefore unpopular character. On the other hand, there were popular merchants who were named kaupdrengir or fardrengir (sing. -drengr, lit. ‘honorable merchant’ or ‘honorable traveller’), several examples of which can be found in the sagas (Gísla saga Súrssonar, ÍF 6:38; Valla-Ljóts saga, ÍF 9:237; Þorgríms þáttr Hallasonar, ÍF 9:303; Reykdœla saga ok Víga-Skútu, ÍF 10:218). Ögmundr earns much wealth in his first voyage, but great contempt as well for cowardice, and Glúmr treats him coldly, considering his voyage to have been a wretched business: “a man sprung from slaves is incapable of noble behavior” (ÍF 9:108). When Ögmundr goes abroad again and performs some noble deeds, without any mention of how much wealth he acquires, Glúmr praises the voyage. In the light of the above, Glúmr's reaction must be seen as illustrating the point of view or ideal of thirteenth-century chieftains that bravery and prowess in battle were more valuable than the acquisition of wealth, and that the only honorable merchants were those who did not allow themselves to be governed by the desire for profit.",NA,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,MALE,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,1119a29fcd,eq02-022,eq02

Among other things, they reveal that it was voluntary and based on mutual trust, by no means the rigid obedience shown by subjects to masters. The chieftain had to show the ability to wield authority in such a way that the farmers wished to be his þingmenn. One of the chieftain's main duties was to support his þingmenn in disputes with other chieftains and their þingmenn, besides [Page 207] maintaining the peace in his chieftaincy and settling conflicts between his own þingmenn. If a chieftain showed the right abilities, he became a popular leader and his reputation would grow. As a result, other farmers wanted to be his þingmenn. However, if he failed, the þingmenn would start looking for a new chieftain; in such cases, they would often actually move out of the district (Byock 1988:103–105; Sigurðsson 1989:25–40).",NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,6da298aaa4,eq02-020,eq02

While in Norway he is often called an idiot before finally proving himself. On his return to Iceland his reputation is only slightly increased. Þorkell the Tall (ÍF 9, ch. 7) is still able to tease, “you're the same sort of idiot now as when you went abroad.” Glúmr kills Sigmundr, rather skillfully waiting to get him on what Glúmr had a good right to call his own land. He thus has a strong legal case, pays no compensation, and buys back his patrimonial farm, Þverá, for half its value. “Glúmr now began to have great prestige in the district” (ch. 10). Glúmr next marries Halldóra Hlífardóttir with whom come “a great deal of money … and now his position was even more respected than before” (ch. 10). Respect and honor from the community also demanded circumspect behavior and some degree of integrity, not just success. Thus when Glúmr's servant, Hallvarðr, is accused of stealing, Glúmr is in favor of paying compensation “rather than pledge my reputation for a man like that.” But Glúmr's son, Vigfúss, demands that Glúmr dismiss the case against him and, as a result, Glúmr “was discredited by doing so” (ch. 18). Later Glúmr makes amends for when Hallvarðr is killed after being accused of a new theft Glúmr asks only a small sum in compensation and then pays for the stolen animals. “This won general approval” (ch. 18). The power of goðar lay in the combination of their wealth, reputation, and, ultimately, their support. The three were interwoven and each affected the others. Support could be inherited in the shape of dependents and tenants or powerful and able kinsmen. Support could be gained by marriage into a wealthy and prominent family. Numerous dependents presupposes a wealth in the form of a good farm or farms, and marriage into a prominent family was at best an improbable prospect for the poor. Wealth and good family increased one's reputation whether or not one had the wit to act effectively in the public political arena. And of course [Page 188] with wealth one could buy friends and supporters. Political success rapidly increased one's reputation bringing with it more support, improving one's ability to act effectively. It was not difficult to capitalize on such ability to increase one's wealth by brokerage in many forms, including legal advocacy. It was a simple matter to coerce little people and take away from them disputed property and make them eager to stand or sit just as one wished. It mattered less whether one's reputation was for being wise, cautious, and generous or for being cruel, hot-tempered, and rapacious than that honor was maintained. Honor, however, could be lost in many ways. So many that the true makings of tragedy were ever present: conflicting loyalties that ultimately produced a fateful, if not fatal, irreconcilable situation; a loveless marriage and divorce would drive powerful and otherwise close families to demand recompense to maintain face, and produce a feud; protecting a hot-blooded young kinsman and reducing his sentence to lesser outlawry could prove tragic when taunts of cowardice caused him to break his conditions of exile and lead to an even less defensible lawsuit. Small dishonors could tarnish a reputation, but major defeats at the hands of enemies and competitors could break a reputation. Without a reputation support melted away and one became defenseless. The defenceless usually suffered the loss of their wealth. But wealth was not simply property, it was support. It was the dependents that went with the farm. It was the thralls, the húsmenn, the tenants, the clients, and the þingmenn.",NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NEUTRAL,NA,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NEUTRAL,MALE,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,44dd36087a,eq02-018,eq02

A [Page 127] skipper's trust and prestige is not given once and for all from the moment he begins to fish, as, for instance, Barth implies (1966: 10) in his account of Norwegian herring fishing in which he speaks of the ‘self-confirming pattern’ whereby ‘good’ skippers get stable crews, fish independently and land high catches. The arena of prestige negotiation is not restricted to the sea, for often it extends into the larger sphere of local relations. For instance, many of those involved in the fishing industry ashore — particularly boat owners and operators of fishing plants — regularly listen to the inter-boat radio, a device fishermen call ‘the spy’, waiting for ‘fishing news’. Local people often compare the performance of skippers, discussing the successful and unsuccessful, the old-timers in relation to the young, and in the process evaluating the relative potential and prestige of individual skippers. Some skippers ‘really do fish’, while others are ‘fish deterrents’. When ashore the skipper has to built up his reputation in a highly subtle manner, since modesty is regarded as a virtue and public staging of self is not tolerated. Typically, skippers' accounts of dangers at sea contain few references to emotional states. Their style is often strangely objective, given the nature of the events described. One skipper whose ship had been caught twice by life-threatening breaking seas during the same fishing trip commented during a chat the next day with fellow fishermen ashore that everything on deck which could possibly get damaged had been smashed, adding laconically that one could ‘take it like snuff’. People sometimes make fun of unsuccessful skippers, but not, it seems, in terms of their extreme lack of success which is regarded more as tragic.

"Campbell, John Kennedy 1970 “Honour and the Devil” In Honor and Shame : The Values of Mediterranean Society, 141–70 Chicago: University of Chicago Press https://ehrafworldculturesyaleedu/document?id=eh01-017","In general, the qualities of manliness are obvious and familiar. A man must be strong in body and spirit. But there is also a nuance of meaning peculiar to a community where values are agonistic and social reputation is frequently at risk. In these circumstances a man must have boundless self-confidence in his own powers. Where few men owe him more than conditional support, and the great majority none at all, he must rely on himself. Manliness implies not only the condition of being courageous but the ability of a man to do something efficient and effective about the problems and dangers which surround him. For [Page 146] in this complex of values results count for almost everything and intentions for very little.  5 I refer here to the relation between a man's true intention (ie his purpose known certainly only in his own conscience) and his public reputation for honour. On the other hand, intentions imputed to a man by public judgement are of critical importance particularly in situations where his behaviour may bear more than one interpretation. The quality required of women in relation to honour is shame, particularly sexual shame. Subjectively the woman's sexual shame is not simply a fear of external sanctions; it is an instinctive revulsion from sexual activity, an attempt in dress, movement, and attitude, to disguise the fact that she possesses the physical attributes of her sex. Maidens must be virgins, and even married women must remain virginal in thought and expression. But honour is always something imputed by others. In these matters the individual woman can never retreat within her own conscience. Her honour depends upon the reputation which the community is willing to concede, not upon the evidence of facts in any case difficult to determine. Therefore she protects her honour most effectively by conforming in every outward aspect of her deportment to a code of sexual shame. The critical moment in the development of the young shepherd's reputation is his first quarrel. Quarrels are necessarily public. They may occur in the coffee-shop, the village square, or most frequently on a grazing boundary where a curse or stone aimed at one of his straying sheep by another shepherd is an insult which inevitably requires a violent response. In any case some account of the event becomes public property. If the quarrel occurs before unrelated bystanders, the community may obtain a reasonably factual account of the fight. If it is not witnessed by an impartial audience, the contestant with the fewer marks of injury and the greater number of persuasive kinsmen wins the day. It is the critical nature of these first important tests of his manliness that makes the self-regard (egoismos) of the young shepherd so extremely sensitive. It is not only the reality of an obvious insult which provokes him to action, but even the finest of allusions on which it is possible to place some unflattering construction. Self-regard is molested where a man is insulted or defamed, or believes himself to have been so treated. If a man behaves towards another in such a way as to suggest that he is not worthy of consideration and recognition, his self-regard is molested; for he only acts in this way towards another when he considers him to be of lesser reputation and, by inference, less honourable. In such circumstances the core of a man's social personality is touched, his manliness and prepotence are questioned. He must respond with violence if he is to avoid self-disesteem. The need is even more pressing if his humiliation has been observed by others and his reputation for honour is at stake. Cleverness, cunning, and skill, are prized because without these capacities stock is managed inexpertly, indifferent grazing is chosen, and bad bargains are made. If he lacks these qualities a man is likely to be, or to become, poor. If he is poor he has no prestige. And without prestige honour, too, is in doubt. For honour is always a question of ascription, not a matter of fact or individual right. Reputation, then, is impossible without strength, skill, cleverness. Man is good only when he is also by implication strong. Although aimless violence is dishonourable there is no missing the pleasure it gives when a man tells of a killing he was obliged to make; nor the prestige which it brings him. There is no more conclusive way of showing that you are stronger than by taking away the other man's life. Conversely all forms of weakness are shameful. So the weak, the humble, the modest, even the merely good-hearted and co-operative, are not virtuous.",NA,MALE,NA,NEUTRAL,MALE,MALE,MALE,MALE,NA,NA,FEMALE,MALE,MALE,NEUTRAL,MALE,NA,NA,NA,NA,MALE,061c1ca611,eh01-017,eh01
